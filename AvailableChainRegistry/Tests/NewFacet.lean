/-! The strong claim domain (Task 4; Review Focus 2). Only a `StrongInstance` can
hold a certificate of a `ClaimSpec ClaimDomain.strong`. An `Instance` without the
strong output has no such claim: the vacuity of `∀ I [HasStrong I], …`
(PHASE0-REPORT §6) cannot occur. A base claim pulls back to a strong instance
with its certificate, and a strong instance with a bad strong output is refuted.

The test claim `test.strongSafe.v1` has its own id. This module is not in the
catalog lock. -/
