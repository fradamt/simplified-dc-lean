/-!
Counterexample to the round-9 universal clean-path extension obligation.
With Δ = 1, n = 4, and one fault, the faulty slot-1 proposer sends two
genesis children at time 4. All three honest nodes receive both. They
choose x at time 5 (its root is larger) and receive all three x HEADs.
At event prefix 42, before the first time-6 tick, the joint invariant
still permits the path {genesis, y}. The time-6 save of N(1,x) then
prevents any extension of that path. This is a failure of the proof
obligation, not of an AvailableChain claim.

The finite checks use kernel reduction. The witness includes the complete
public schedule, self-delivery, signature provenance, accepted relay,
root injectivity, and the cap. It starts at the actual engine init.
