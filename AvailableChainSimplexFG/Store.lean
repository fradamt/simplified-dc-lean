/-- [pin fj.frame.v3] The FG part of a node store (DC-fj). `TF` is the ONE admitted,
parent-closed tree (the spec's `Σ.T`, Trees paragraph, alfs4 lines 352–371;
initialization 474–482; DC `consensus.tex` 1720–1739). The spec admits a block
B only if `F ⪯ B` at that time (line 354); this history is NOT formalized (no
ghost field records it), and no lemma needs it. The tree is cumulative: no block is
deleted when F advances. There is no raw tree. `F`, `J`, `h_j` and `h_max` are
DC's live caches; they are the frame controls. `h_max` only grows (DC line
864). The field keeps the name `TF` so that the pinned statements do not
change. -/

/-- [pin fj.frame.v3] `on_block`, FG part (alfs4 lines 792–817; DC `consensus.tex` 1720–1739).
In the spec's order, it refuses a block that is already in the tree or whose
parent is not in the tree (lines 794–795), a block with `F ⋠ B` (line 796), and
a block whose slot is not greater than its parent's slot (line 798: the spec
makes DC's `assert B.parent.slot < B.slot` of `state_transition`, DC
`consensus.tex` lines 791 and 2220, a refusal). Each refusal comes before the
block's state is computed (lines 806–807)
or its objects are unpacked: the store does not change. Otherwise the block
enters the tree (line 808) and `update_finality` runs (line 812).
FG admission input contract (the caller passes only blocks that satisfy it;
`on_block` does not test it): (1) the future-slot bound `B.slot ≤ Σ.s` (line
794; the node's slot is not in `Store`); (2) the slot-`B.slot` proposer
signature (lines 798–799); (3) the row-round check (lines 802–805; DC §7, "no
row from the block's future"; `Row` has no round field). Each item can
refuse a block that this function accepts. No lemma of this plan uses them: the
lemmas quantify over all `StoreInv` stores and all blocks, so they stay sound
for the stores of the spec. The vote and row pools are the AP's. -/

/-! ### Review Focus 2: the invariant is necessary

A stale store: `B1` is in the tree, but `h_max` and the pair are those of
`{genesis}`. It violates `StoreInv` (Kit). Its controls give `lo = 1 − 1 = 0`;
the controls of its tree give `H = 2`, `lo = 1`. -/

/-! ### Review Focus 5 and ALFS: a contested store (reachable)

`stC` is reached by `on_block` from `Store.init` with the blocks of the
contest test of Frame.lean (Review Focus 1): `B1a`, `childA`, `B1b`, `Y`, `X`. No block carries a
finality pair, so `F = genesis`. The pair is `(2, B1a)` (from `childA`), and `Y`
(height 3) does not extend `B1a`: the store is contested, `lo = H = 3`. -/

/-- [helper] The contested store, reached by `on_block`. -/
def stC : Store (Fin 4) := [B1a, childA, B1b, Y, X].foldl (on_block E4 cfg1) Store.init

/-- The caches of `stC`, field by field. (The derived `DecidableEq Store` does
not reduce when the two trees are one set in a different insertion order: it
casts along `TF = TF'`, which holds only as a proposition. So the fields are
compared one by one.) -/
example : stC.TF = {.genesis, B1a, childA, B1b, Y, X} ∧ stC.F = .genesis ∧
    stC.J = B1a ∧ stC.h_j = 2 ∧ stC.h_max = 3 := by
  decide +kernel

/-- On the reachable store `stC`, the live caches are the controls of its tree
(the central lemma `storeControls_eq_fjControls`, Kit). -/

    (storeControls E4 cfg1 stC).j = (fjControls E4 cfg1 stC.F stC.TF).j ∧
    (storeControls E4 cfg1 stC).J = (fjControls E4 cfg1 stC.F stC.TF).J ∧
    (storeControls E4 cfg1 stC).contest = (fjControls E4 cfg1 stC.F stC.TF).contest := by
  decide +kernel

/-- Review Focus 5: in a contest, acceptance viability (band start `H − 1 = 2`)
holds `X` (height 2), and the filtered tree (band start `lo = 3`) does not. -/

    X ∈ acceptViable E4 cfg1 stC ∧ X ∉ storeFrame E4 cfg1 stC stC.TF := by
  decide +kernel

/-- The frozen-tree form: over the smaller set without `Y`, the store controls
(contest, `Z = genesis`, `lo = 3`) drop `X`; the controls of that set (no
contest, `Z = B1a`, `lo = 2`) keep it. The controls come from the store, not
from the set. -/
example : X ∉ storeFrame E4 cfg1 stC {.genesis, B1a, childA, B1b, X} ∧
    X ∈ (fjFrame E4 cfg1 .genesis {.genesis, B1a, childA, B1b, X}).D := by

/-- The empty frozen domain (Astra K01; ldp L6): the store is contested

/-! ### Review Focus 7: refusal (alfs4 lines 794–798) and the active view

`B1`, `B2`, `B3` are Astra's G02 chain (TwoChanges.lean reuses them). `B2` (slot 2)
carries three targets for `(2, B1)`: state height 3, pair `(2, B1)`. `B3`
(slot 3) carries three timeouts for `(3, B2)`, each with the finality pair
`(2, B1)`: state height 4, and it finalizes `B1`. `B1'` (slot 2, parent
genesis) carries three targets at height 1 for genesis: it conflicts with `B1`.
Each block has body `0`, and each row names a derived root. With the same
content, `B2` is `childA` of Frame.lean and `B1'` is `B1c`: a block is its
content. -/

/-- The G02 chain: `B2` justifies `B1` at height 2; `B3` reaches height 4 and
finalizes `B1`. -/

    (derive E4 cfg1 B2).J = B1 ∧ (derive E4 cfg1 B3).h = 4 ∧
