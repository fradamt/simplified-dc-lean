/-- [FRAMEWORK E2, E5; 2a Task 3 Step 5; DC N9] The FG-SA label families (the 2a
reference assignment): the AP labels are the HEAD and the proposal labels; the
designated fresh family is the HEAD labels; the linked family is the FG
labels. A proposal label has one seat, so it is not fresh (`CStar` needs
`seats ℓ = |V|`); it is `SingleSeat`. -/

/-- [FRAMEWORK E5 (:294–319); plan T7.2] The isolation value. The base is the
store (`Node.st`): F and its basis are in the base (E5 restore law), and Λ is
not. `clock`, `process` and `recordOwn` act on the base through the store
functions; the AP payloads (`actS`) and the hooks (`depsS`, `processedS`,
`excludesS`, `handlesS`) read only the store, so `hooks_base` holds by `rfl`
for every object (the isolation check: the hooks on AP labels and unsigned
objects read neither Λ nor pending state; the proposal hooks read F and the
store, which E5 allows).

`separation` (2a field; FRAMEWORK dated E5 note :302–306, 7e40fba): the
restriction applies to the AP labels and to the designated fresh family, not
to every `CStar` family. So the FG labels, which are `Linked`, may be
self-visible (Opus m16, closed). -/
