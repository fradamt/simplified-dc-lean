/-! WP12b: Ruling U's simulation-only filter removes non-Assigned proposal chains.
The identity gate, store invariant, emission identity, and event stutter are proved below.
The old raw-erasure trace remains as regression evidence. A second initialized trace
checks block acceptance after restart with the retained clock of ruling Y.
Ruling X fixes row targets as root names in spec pin f54e403a.
Dependency/freshness normalization has a complete target-state induction and validity proof.
The independent source-handler, clock/lock relation and regime transfer remain unproved.
No Lean protocol or existing claim is changed. -/
