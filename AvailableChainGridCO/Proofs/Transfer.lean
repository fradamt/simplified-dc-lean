/-- Receipt conditions for one source result and one next ordinary view.
The source's clean supporters occur in the resolved view. A raw vote
relays back to the source's late pool, or that pool already contains
equivocation evidence. The support view is a raw subset. This follows
the two-copy cap in reference Goldfish `AdoptionTransport`. -/
