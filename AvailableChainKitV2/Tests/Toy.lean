/-! ROOT-DIGEST W3: explicit roots for finite test fixtures. -/

/-! A toy protocol on engine v2 and a complete valid run (plan 2a, Task 6;
Review Focus 4; Task 5 review M1).

The toy has receipts in the base and the own record outside it, a clock that
keeps the state, one `Linked` self-visible label `row` (two seats, one for
each validator) whose payload is a row that the node has not signed before
and that carries nothing, and one one-seat AP proposal label `prop s` for
each slot `s`. It has `Interface`, `Isolation`, `OutputsFactor` and
`HooksSound` values.

The run `toyRun` has two honest validators and twelve events: at time 0 both
tick and every released object goes to both nodes, among them a self-delivery
at the emission time; at time 1 both tick and the proposal of slot 1 goes to
both nodes. The run is `ExecutionValid`, it satisfies `SelfDelivery`,
`PartialSynchrony` and `HealthyPrefixDelivery` at every cut, and the
hypotheses of `selfDelivery_admissible` hold at the self-delivery of
validator 0. A second, shorter run `pre` shows the append form
`ExecutionValid.snoc_selfDelivery`.

Limits. In the runs, every row is `row 0`: the row label is due only at time
0, when the own record is empty. The row payload reads the own record only
in an off-run check. The toy does not exercise exclusion (`excludes` is
`false`), carried objects (`carries` is `False`), the fresh family (it is
empty) or restarts (`restore` is the identity; restart toys are plan 2c). -/

/-! ### The append form (Task 6 review M1)

`ExecutionValid.snoc_selfDelivery` on the toy: a valid prefix `pre` with two
honest validators, an event of the other node after the tick (so `hlast` is
not vacuous), receipts that `processed` reads, and an own record that
changes the state. Its premise `hkey` (every event key at most `(t, 2)`) and
the field `tick_total` force the appended run to end at time `t`: its
horizon is below the next public time. So a witness that continues after the
self-delivery, like `toyRun`, needs the direct proof above. -/
