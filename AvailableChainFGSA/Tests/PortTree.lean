example : FGBlock.genesis ∈ st.fg.TF ∧ FGBlock.genesis ∉ tree p st := by decide

example : first ∈ tree p st ∧ second ∈ tree p st := by decide

example : fork ∈ st.fg.TF ∧ fork ∉ tree p st ∧

/-- [spec 305–326, 975–1015] The erased tree keeps the cumulative list order;
the base list and its resolution domain still hold the ancestor below F. -/
example : erasedList st (tree p st) = [eraseFG second, eraseFG first] ∧

/-- [spec 305–326] Genesis is included in the initial tree. -/
