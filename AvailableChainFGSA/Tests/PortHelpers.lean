/-- Regression for `port_confirmation_filter`: non-equivocation is necessary
when the projected support pool also supplies the raw argument. -/
example :

    GridCO.goldfishScore v.blocks raw raw head = 1 ∧

/-- Regression for `port_ghost_congr`: equal score/root ties remain ambiguous. -/
example :

/-- Regression for `port_resolvedHead_filter`: the cumulative collision stays
unresolved even though only one candidate survives the prefix projection. -/

/-- Regression for `port_releaseCount_eq`: release counts can differ for an
incompatible target, while the compatible retained target has equal counts. -/

although the strict-ancestor vote is absent from the projected clean pool. -/

/-- Regression for `port_retained_raw_carry`: held metadata alone is not a
retention proof. Removing the proposal also removes its raw vote. -/

/-- Regression for `port_lease_projection`: the ancestor row can be removed
without changing the retained target's deadline. -/
example :
    let st : State 3 := { base := { v with obligations := [(ancestor, 1, 10), (head, 1, 20)] } }
    leaseOf { st with base := { st.base with
      obligations := st.base.obligations.filter (fun row => Block.preceq floor row.1) } } head =

/-- Instantiates `port_support_filter_score` at genesis; unresolved votes
can be removed from support without changing any score for the fixed raw pool. -/
