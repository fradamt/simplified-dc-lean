/-- A protocol for engine v2 (design §2 E1, E2, E5, E6).

`In` is the type of the run-chosen input (for example a transaction list). It
is a parameter, not a field, so a protocol cannot choose it: the claim domain
fixes it. The run gives an input to every validator at every time
(`Run.input`); `act` reads it.

The type mentions no validator, so honest code has no identity, no key, and
one shared initial state. Honest code decides payloads; the engine signs them
(`tick`). The state changes only through `clock`, `recordOwn` (at a tick),
`process` (at a delivery) and `restore` (at a restart). A node does not know
its seats, and it can use only what a node that holds no seat can also
compute. -/

  State : Type
  /-- Duty labels. A proposal duty is a label with one seat. -/
  Label : Type

  committee size. -/

  /-- The private own-signature record: at its tick, a node records every
  object that it signs with a self-visible label (design §2 E5). -/

  /-- The node's state already holds the object. -/
  processed : State → Signed Label seats Payload → Bool
  /-- The node's state excludes the object for good: the node rejects it now and
  in every later state of the same restart epoch. Delivery obligations do not
  apply to excluded objects. -/
  excludes : State → Signed Label seats Payload → Bool
  /-- In state `s`, the delivery of the first object makes the node handle the
  second (the object itself, or one carried inside it). `handles` is the
  handler-call gate; it can hold even when the object is rejected. -/
