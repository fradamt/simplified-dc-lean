/-! Origin laws for a protocol whose delivery event can admit several bodies: the
delivered one and bodies that were pending before the event. They replace
`FGSafetyStoreLaws.process_new`, which allows one new block per delivery, and that block
is the delivered object. PROVISIONAL, as the other safety contracts. -/
