/-! # The pin table of the FG module (DC-fj)

Each pin is one id of `docs/FG-COMPOSITION.md`. It records its coverage CLAUSE
BY CLAUSE (Astra G08); there is no `full` tag for an id. A clause is covered by
Lean names (with their extra hypotheses), or it names the paper step, the
registry id or the AP fact that carries it. A clause that the Lean statements
only ASSUME is `byHyp`: it names the hypothesis and the lemmas that can
discharge it. A row that a definition covers (with at most an unfolding lemma)
is `leanHyp … "definition only"`. A clause can also cite a `[helper]` theorem
that is one branch, a special case or a partial form of the clause
(`on_block_of_refused`, `crossing_other_entry`, `Fmove_below`,
`twoChanges_nested`); its docstring says which. Every other cited theorem has a
`[pin <id>]` docstring; a definition cited in `defPins` can be `[helper]`
(`derive`, `createRow`). A name can be cited under an id other than the id of its
tag: the tag names its main id, and a row of another id can use it (for example
`mem_filteredFrom`, tagged `fj.frame.v4`, in `fj.frame.v1`).

`scripts/FGPinIds.lean` prints `manifest` of the elaborated values, and
`scripts/check-fg-pins.sh` checks it against the registry. `scripts/FGPinIds.lean
--check-names` checks that every Lean name of this table is a constant of the
two FG libraries, so that `scripts/CheckFGAxioms.lean` checks its axioms.
`scripts/check-fg.sh` builds the two libraries and runs every check.

A clause can also cite constants of a library above the FG libraries with
`leanIn lib names` (single-backtick names, so this file does not import that
library). `scripts/FGPinIds.lean` rejects a `lib` that is not on its allowlist,
and `scripts/check-fgsa.sh` checks those names in the environment of `lib`. The
pin gate for a pin with `leanIn` evidence is `scripts/check-fg.sh` plus
`scripts/check-fgsa.sh`.

A registry id in the free text of a clause (its label or a string field) is a
dependency of the pin: the manifest records it (`mention`), and the pin check
applies the status rule to it as to an `.ap` or `.external` id. A citation that
is only history goes inside a `(history: …)` marker, which the scan skips. This
file does not import a library above the FG libraries; `scripts/CheckFGAxioms.lean`
checks the import closure of the two FG roots.

Root injectivity. The root of an FG block is a function of its content
(`FGBlock.root_injective`), so the binders `ViewRootInj` and `RootInjectiveOn`
are not run idealizations: `viewRootInj_all` and `rootInjectiveOn_all` prove
them for every view and every two tips. The statements keep them as binders; a
clause below that names one of them is discharged by these two lemmas. -/
