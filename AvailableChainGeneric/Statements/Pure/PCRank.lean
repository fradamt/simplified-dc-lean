/-! Generic Pure layer: an abstract PC record, its rank order and the
held-PC update `preferPC`. Source: `pcsa-decisions.md` (R-c, R-e, R-f; user
decision 2026-10-05 23:11) and `pcsa-v2-plan-fable.md` M0; the SAPC templates
are `AvailableChainSAPC/Model/Certificates.lean:38` (`preferPC`) and
`AvailableChainSAPC/Proofs/Rank.lean:11` (`PCRankLE`). The record keeps the
acker seat set and leaves the ack carrier to the instance. The rank compares
the slot, then a tie key of a linear order that the instance picks.
