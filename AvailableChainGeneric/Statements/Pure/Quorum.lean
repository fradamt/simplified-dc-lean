/-! Generic Pure layer: positive weights, the unit-weight quorum, and the regime
records `FaultQ`, `FaultX` and `Batch` (GLY A.3, C.1, E-5; ruling D05).
Definitions and defining equations only. Each regime record has one field,
so a proof reads that field and needs no equation lemma. -/

/-- The unit-weight quorum `q_F = (2n+2) div 3`. The body is the body of
`AvailableChain.SimplexFG.Electorate.q` (AvailableChainSimplexFG/Objects.lean:209,
`(2 * E.totalWeight + 2) / 3`) with `E.totalWeight = n`, its value for unit
weights. -/
