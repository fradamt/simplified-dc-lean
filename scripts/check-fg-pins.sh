#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Checks the ELABORATED pin table of AvailableChainKitFG/Pins.lean against
# docs/FG-COMPOSITION.md. It builds the two FG libraries (the emitter reads
# the built .olean files, which Lean does not compare with the sources), runs
# scripts/FGPinIds.lean in this run and reads only its output. Threat model:
# the check guards against emitter and parser bugs, stale registry data, stale
# builds and superseded or withdrawn ids, not against a hand-edited manifest;
# so the manifest is never stored.
# 0) The emitter exits 0. Every record matches the strict grammar
#      src <key> <root> <path> <sha256> | <kind> <id> | <dep|mention> <pin> <id>
#    (kind pin, ap, external, notFormalized or hist). The last eight lines are
#    the trailers "END <kind> <n> <sorted keys>" for src, pin, ap, external,
#    notFormalized, dep, hist, mention, in this order (the key of a dep or
#    mention record is <pin>/<id>). No (kind, key) pair repeats (a repeated
#    hist line fails), for each kind the sorted record keys are the trailer's
#    keys, no id is both a pin and a notFormalized id, every hist id and the
#    first id of every dep and mention record is a pin id, and the dep targets
#    are exactly the ap and external ids. Else exit 2.
# 1) each src resolves to its REGISTERED version (tsc/: the archive copy by
#    hash; spec and blueprint: the archived file; vc and dc: the registered Git
#    commit), and that version has the pinned hash;
# 2) each src (key, path, hash) is exactly the row of its key in the §0.1
#    tables (a continuation line counts only when its key column is blank);
# 3) each pin, ap, external and notFormalized id is, literally, the id of an
#    entry heading, and has exactly one row in the "## Index" table;
# 4) the status test. An id NAMED BY A CURRENT PIN (a pin that is not a hist
#    pin) is its own id, each id of its dep records (.ap and .external), and
#    each registry id in its free text (the clause label and every string
#    field of its coverage) outside a "(history: ...)" marker (the mention
#    records; blueprint ids "bp.*" are skipped). Such an id must have exactly
#    one Index row, and its status there must not contain WITHDRAWN or
#    SUPERSEDED as a token (any case, anywhere: "REFUTED; WITHDRAWN" counts).
#    Ids that only hist pins name are exempt, and so are notFormalized ids that
#    no current pin names. Direct edges suffice: in Pins.lean (the Cov type)
#    only .ap and .external carry an id, and the free text is scanned. A pin
#    named by a current pin is either a hist pin, whose own status fails here
#    (step 5 makes sure that a hist pin is WITHDRAWN or SUPERSEDED), or a
#    current pin, whose own names are tested as a current pin's names. So no
#    transitive closure is needed.
# 5) the hist pins are exactly the ids of the allowlist HIST below. Each
#    allowlist entry has an id, a date and a reason (else exit 2; a duplicate
#    entry also exits 2). A hist pin with no allowlist entry fails; an
#    allowlist entry with no hist record fails; a hist pin whose Index status
#    does not contain WITHDRAWN or SUPERSEDED as a token fails.
# Exit codes: 0 clean; 1 a registry or allowlist mismatch (steps 1–5); 2 a
# failed build (BUILD FAILED), a failed emitter, a bad manifest (step 0), a
# missing registry, or a malformed or duplicate allowlist entry.
# `leanIn` names (constants of a library above the FG libraries) are not in
# the manifest. The emitter fails in step 0 when a `leanIn` library is not on
# its allowlist; scripts/check-fgsa.sh checks the names themselves. The pin
# gate for a pin with `leanIn` evidence is check-fg.sh plus check-fgsa.sh.
# Negative tests only: FGPINIDS=<file> runs another emitter script,
# FGREG=<file> reads another registry, FGHISTALLOW=<file> reads another
# allowlist (scripts/check-fg.sh runs these controls; the script prints a
# warning on stderr when one is set, and check-fg.sh unsets them for its
# positive run).
