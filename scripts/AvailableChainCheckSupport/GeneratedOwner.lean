/-! The owner of a generated constant, for the check scripts
(`scripts/CheckFGSARunAxioms.lean`, `scripts/CheckFGSALease.lean`,
`scripts/CheckFGSARunLease.lean`).

Lean realizes a generated constant (an equation, a matcher splitter or
congruence equation, a sparse `casesOn` and its fallback equation) in the first
module that needs it, possibly as a private copy, for example the matcher
equation `_private.M.0.X.match_1.eq_2`. So the module of a generated constant
does not tell where its definition is; its owner does. The rule has no list of
names.

This library imports only `Lean`. No protocol library may import it
(`scripts/check-fgsa.sh`). -/

/-- A last name component that Lean generates for a definition: an equation
(`eq_<k>`, `eq_def`), a matcher splitter or congruence equation (`splitter`,
`congr_eq_<k>`), or a sparse `casesOn` and its fallback equation
(`_sparseCasesOn_<k>`, `else_eq`). -/

  let numbered (pre : String) :=
    s.startsWith pre && !(s.drop pre.length).isEmpty && (s.drop pre.length).all Char.isDigit

/-- The declared constant `n`, or the declared constant of the user name of
the private name `n`. -/

  if env.contains n then some n else
    match privateToUserName? n with
    | some u => if env.contains u then some u else none
    | none => none

/-- The owner of a generated constant: strip one generated last component at a
time (`generatedSuffix`) until the name is a declared constant (directly, or
through the user name of a private name). `none` if the last component of `n`
is not generated, or if no owner is found. -/

/-- The owner of `n` if `n` is a generated constant of a definition outside
the scope `inScope` (a module test on the owner). A check skips such a
constant as a checked constant: it states the body of its owner, which is not
a declaration of the checked library. -/
