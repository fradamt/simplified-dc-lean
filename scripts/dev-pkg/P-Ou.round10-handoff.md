# P-Ou Round 10 handoff

Base: aef1dd45. Branch: sleep-pou10.
P-Ou is PREPARED, not CLOSED. The complete Round 10 task is incomplete.
Public claims and protocol declarations are unchanged.

## Proved prefix and read facts

ScopedInduction:28, outage_good_head_through_restored, permits the actual good HEAD
at r. :102, outage_event_induction_before_vote_cut, takes an exact vote-label bound
for its finite endpoint. The original two theorem signatures remain as wrappers.
No existing caller needs a new premise.

ScopedPrefix:15 defines regression only at an actual emitted HEAD with the scoped
joined reader guard. :40 selects the first label. :55 selects the first event,
including earlier reads at the same label. These are branch selections, not proofs
that a regression exists in every run.

ScopedPrefix:93 constructs the auxiliary zero-length arming regime. Its W set is
contained in the actual continuation W set, so the actual E1 bound suffices.
:151 produces the source history, named history, G-only stable seed and label-r
good-target coverage at I0 = afterTicksIdx rho (earlyTime r). It uses the actual
arming certificate, P-Cl1 Clean state/provenance and P-Fd foundation. The endpoint
is freezeTime r; only labels <= r can supply its good HEADs. The length-V bound
keeps this endpoint before the original covering deadline. The horizon guard
is earlyTime r <= horizon, supplied whenever a later actual gate needs the seed.

ScopedPrefix:235 proves the no-regression continuation from those producers.
It takes no source, stable, result or service seed. E supplies the first restored
batch. Later gates use earlier actual scoped HEADs. Sources and F compatibility
are global; stable inclusion is G-only. :298 produces the finite prefix at the
first actual regression from the first-event branch. This does not produce the
prefix after that regression through the marker suffix's initial cut.

ScopedPrefix:338 proves frozen-path membership at the actual joined reader.
The earlier receipt tick is strictly after that reader's join cutoff and no later
than its freeze. The actual join proves both stamp-epoch facts. P-Fd durable TF
and RStoreEpoch preserve the selected path and its strict original stamp.
This theorem does not promise receipt of every durable carrier at every receiver.
:394 constructs a stored nonzero marker from an actual contested named frame.
:415 proves contest from local retained scores and the uncontested filtered-path
witnesses. Those two local producers remain O10-2 below.

ScopedContinuation:157 proves a later actual joined HEAD from the marker, current
names and earlier results at that read. :194 now permits r <= m < r+k, with the
finite prefix ending after gate max(m,r+k). The induction uses :157 directly.
This removes the late-marker restriction; it does not construct the early bridge.

ScopedCatchUp:16 extracts the actual public W-reader gate and its awake suffix.
The regime produces that gate's batch at earlyTime s. The actual joined gate
produces the epoch from actionCut(voteTime s) to idxBefore(earlyTime s).
The gate label is >= r+k. Its HEAD can still be inside E at the boundary.
:54 proves all inclusive output inclusions in the local B <= F branch.
The other W output branch remains O10-4.

## Exact remaining P-Ou obligations

Common telescope: the actual OutageContinuationSleepPrem, FGFoundation, TSrc,
SrcFrameAboveStmt, emitted-name supplier, P-Cl1 CleanState at indices <= timeIdx b0,
ArmingJoinedProvenance, and ArmingSleepGateCert for the protected non-genesis B.
These are the complete arguments of outage_first_regression_prefix at
ScopedPrefix:298. Use the selected first actual regression and its first-event
absence guard from :55. The prefix's source/names/F/G conclusions are produced.
No NoRestart or all-honest stable seed is available from this telescope.

- O10-1: connect the no-regression and first-event branches to the public
  arming/read assembly, including reads before I0. The core no-regression
  continuation and its initial seed are proved. The actual certificate is a
  P-Ar producer, not an extra public premise.
- O10-2: at that first actual joined regression, produce hRoot, hScores and hPath
  with exactly the types in ScopedPrefix:415. hPath is requested only under
  contest=false. Use the preceding selected joined good voters, the actual E
  count (or the healthy count beyond E), their exact local retained services,
  receiver F floors and stamp epochs. :338 supplies frozen membership once the
  selected path has its actual receipt. Then :415 gives contest, and :394 gives
  P in TF, B <= J(P), and h_j(P) != 0. A conversion or assumed scope is not the
  missing producer. The local root argument outside G before handover also
  needs its actual compatible live rows; do not use an all-honest S invariant.
- O10-3: from that marker, produce the complete finite prefix through
  I = afterTicksIdx rho (gateTime (max m (r+k))). The exact seed telescope is
  ScopedContinuation:194. Required outputs are:

```lean
OutageSourceHistory p c E rho (eraseFG B) I
∀ x ∈ coveredNodes p E rho fast b₀,
  Block.Preceq (eraseFG B) (S_at p c E rho I x)
∀ j x s C, j < I → x ∈ rho.honest → restoredLabel p b₁ < s →
  enabledGateAt p c E rho j x s → gateResultAt p c E rho j = some (some C) →
  Block.Compatible C (eraseFG B)
```

  The first-read prefix at ScopedPrefix:298 stops before the marker. It is not
  this later prefix. The suffix theorem produces all results after this cut;
  it requests no future HEAD or result callback.
- O10-4: at the actual W gate returned by ScopedCatchUp:16, prove compatibility
  of the post-gate S with B in the branch where B is not below the reader F.
  Carry the actual batch, epoch and awake interval into the bounded continuation
  to the public read. Compatible raw results alone do not establish a new
  stable seed at an arbitrary W receiver. No all-honest inclusion is requested.
- O10-5: obtain global hHeads by joining the no-marker branch, first-read prefix,
  early bridge and causal marker suffix. Quantify only over actual scoped joined
  readers and actual emitted targets. Later marker targets need compatibility;
  keep covering-target demands inside actual protected or independently proved
  covering branches. Then port ContinuationJoint:671/:871, Close:84, the legacy
  continuation targets and both complete public exporters.

All five obligations stay P-Ou. No new P-Ar, P-Cl1, P-H1 or P-As request is made.
The original six P-Ou EXPECTED-FAIL entries remain; none is reclassified by a
partial source theorem. Public consumer builds still reach removed noRestart
projections and obsolete all-honest induction calls. No public STOP is claimed.

## Scope regressions and validation

Tests/OutageLaterHeads retains the wake=9, GST=20 and fixed E-window guards.
New tests distinguish a post-End gate from a post-End HEAD count, show that the
early-marker finite cut follows a HEAD used by the next gate, and exclude an
asleep deterministic read from actual regression selection. These are checked
scope regressions, not complete ExecutionValid counterexample runs.

Validation results and commit hashes are in the Round 10 report.
Evidence: .lake/sleep-pou-r10/. No checker, baseline, allowance, toolchain,
heartbeat, public claim or protocol source is changed.

## SCOPE-NARROW input audit

The table retains all Round 9 roles and adds the Round 10 roles. YES is conditional
on the stated actual read, branch, floor, epoch or finite prefix. It does not mean
that an OPEN producer has been proved. The protected B and arming certificate are
part of the common telescope. Legacy all-honest inputs in EXPECTED-FAIL code are
port failures, not supplier requests from the active sleep interface.
