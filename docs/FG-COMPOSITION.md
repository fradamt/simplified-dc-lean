# FG composition registry (v2, 2026-09-28)

_Owner: the async-resilience session (research). ethereum-f1 keeps this file
consistent with FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7._

## 0. Registry policy (audit W08)

- Each entry PINS its statement and its hypotheses. The pinned text is an
  exact copy of the cited source lines. It does not change when the source
  changes. Links inside pinned text are relative to `tsc/`.
- Each entry names its module variant: `nj` (`SimplexFG.nj`, DC's NJ rule),
  `fj` (`SimplexFG.fj`, the FJ root rule), or `both`. An AP-side entry names
  the variant whose frame its premises use.
- Each entry names its source file, section and line range, and the SHA-256
  of that source file at registration (§0.1).
- A change of statement or hypotheses gets a new id. The old id stays, with
  the status WITHDRAWN. Ids with an unchanged statement stay.
- The status is a dated line. A later status change adds a new dated line
  below the old one. It does not change the pinned statement.
- Status values: LEAN (a Lean certificate); PROVED (a paper proof from the
  pinned hypotheses); PROVED* (a paper proof, conditional on the listed
  unproved entries); SKETCH (a proof with an identified missing step); OPEN
  (no proof and no refutation); REFUTED (a counterexample); RULE (true by
  the honest code, not a theorem); def (a definition); WITHDRAWN (no
  composite may cite the entry); SUPERSEDED (the entry stays as a pointer;
  its pinned text does not change; a composite cites the named successor
  ids, whose conjunction states the same fact).
- Lean coverage kind (rule added 2026-09-28; text corrected the same
  day): BY HYPOTHESIS = the Lean theorem assumes, as a named premise, a
  statement equivalent to the clause (or to the clause's key step); the
  entry names the discharging ids. It differs from PARTIAL, where Lean
  derives the clause from extra premises. It is a coverage note, not a
  status value.
- Two edits of a hypotheses list keep the id, with a dated note: (a) the
  replacement of a SUPERSEDED id by its successor ids; (b) a new reference
  by id to a fact that the pinned text already uses (for example "F4" or
  "finalized crossing"). Any other change of hypotheses gets a new id.
- Pins to spec text resolve against `spec/archive/` by hash (rule added
  2026-09-28): a pin to `spec/<name>.tex` with sha256 h refers to
  `spec/archive/<name>-<first 8 hex digits of h>.tex`, whose sha256 is h.
  The spec owner archives each registered spec version there before an
  edit. The live `spec/` file can differ.
- Research sources are archived by hash (rule added 2026-09-28): at
  registration, the registry owner copies each pinned research source
  that is not in Git to `<dir>/archive/<name>-<first 8 hex digits of
  sha256>.<ext>` (for `tsc/`: `tsc/archive/`) and checks its hash. Pins
  resolve against the archive copy with the registered hash, not against
  the live file. A source in Git is recorded with its commit instead.
- "FG-SA" in a status means a proof for the FG-SA client, that is, the
  Simplex policy with honest non-equivocating signers. As a certificate
  FAMILY over every policy σ, an AP-side entry still needs a proof that uses
  only frame conditions and AP facts (FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.3, audit W02).
  [async] An entry that states FG height progress is never a family entry;
  it holds for the Simplex policy only.
- AP-side ids (`ap.*`) state only AP SERVICE facts: repair, common fresh
  sources, row service, block retention and source safety
  (FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.3, audit W02). A height rise, an FG entry law or
  a record permission is a `comp.*` or `fg.*` entry, derived after
  specialization to the Simplex policy.

### 0.1 Sources

`tsc/` = `research/async-resilient-committees/tip-stability/codex/`. [async]
`r146` = `fgsa-adj` of v1. Section numbers and line ranges replace the v1
line numbers. `r144o` is the Opus variant of r144. `r151` is `fj-theorem-h.md`.
`ldp` is `fgsa-live-dc-port.md` (ALFS proofs), `r157` is
`fgsa-live-views.md`, and `h12` is `fj-h12.md` (all registered and archived
2026-09-28). `r158` is `alfs-redteam.md`, the independent red-team of
ALFS (registered and archived 2026-09-28). `r159` is `alfs-fixes.md`, the
ALFS fixes and vote-merge proof check (the spec cites it as FIX;
registered and archived 2026-09-28). `r160` is `receipt-relay.md`, the
receipt-relay audit (the spec cites it as RR; registered and archived
2026-09-28). `r161` is `filtered-base.md`, the filtered SA base (the spec
cites it as FB), and `r163` is `spec-filtered.md`, the report of the
spec edit a3e12c57 (both registered and archived 2026-09-28). `r152` is `fj-first-finality.md`, `r153` is `fj-reach.md`, and `r153a` is
the Opus adjudication of r153, `fj-reach-adjudicate.md` (verdict VALID WITH
CORRECTIONS; registered 2026-09-28). `r153b` is a later version of the same
file, with §§A–C; §C.4 retracts the NJ claim of r153a. Line numbers cited
as r153a refer to the r153a version (sha256 `c85c0dcc…`), which is not
archived; the live file is r153b.

Archive (2026-09-28): every `tsc/` file in the table above is copied to
`tsc/archive/<name>-<hash8>.md`, with its hash verified (for example
`tsc/archive/fj-redteam-934fe292.md`). r153a cannot be archived: the
adjudicator edited the file in place, and the `c85c0dcc` version is lost.
r153b is archived as `tsc/archive/fj-reach-adjudicate-12afc81c.md`.
`dc/consensus.tex` is in the research Git repository (commit `9f5ed71`,
file unchanged at that commit); Git keeps the registered version.

Sources outside `tsc/` (registered 2026-09-28). `spec/` =
`research/async-resilient-committees/tip-stability/spec/`. `dc/` =
`research/healing/rewrite/`. `vc/` =
`lean/decoupled-consensus/verified-consensus/` at commit `b97b902`. `ac/` =
`lean/available-chain/` at commit `ae2a9d3` (the SA Lean model; the file is
unchanged since `588d666`). `alfs` is the ALFS spec (the DC-form rewrite),
registered 2026-09-28 from its archive copy; a pin to it names the file
`fgsa-protocol-183f2c40.tex`. "Under ALFS (spec 183f2c40)" in a status
line means the protocol of that spec. `alfs2` is the ALFS spec after r159
(the admitted-proposal HEAD vote merge, the δ_t scope, §5 row 29 on
relay, the bounds 996Δ and 1041Δ, no NJ appendix), registered
2026-09-28 from its archive copy; a pin to it names the file
`fgsa-protocol-c7c41a43.tex`. "Under ALFS (spec c7c41a43)" means that
protocol. `alfs3` is the ALFS spec after r160 (DC's receipt premise in
place of accepted-object relay; §5 row 29 class (b); the OPEN item "SA
Lean under the receipt premise"), registered 2026-09-28 from its archive
copy; a pin to it names the file `fgsa-protocol-1c6952b6.tex`. "Under
ALFS (spec 1c6952b6)" means that protocol. Re-pin rule (2026-09-28): the
live entries that pin ALFS text pin the newest registered ALFS spec.
Historical entries keep their pins: `ap.headReachesLo.v2` (`alfs`),
`ap.headReachesLo.v3` (`alfs2`), `fj.frame.v2` and
`ap.headReachesLo.v4` (`alfs3`). Pins to `spec` stay. `alfs4` is the
ALFS spec with the filtered SA base (user decision 2026-09-28; r161):
Σ.T is DC's cumulative admitted tree, `on_block` refuses `F ⋠ B` before
it unpacks the block, the SA base reads the active view act(Σ) (the
blocks compatible with F), `reconcile_with_finality` runs on each F
advance, and there is no raw tree. It is registered 2026-09-28 from its
archive copy; a pin to it names the file `fgsa-protocol-bd942ca0.tex`,
and "under ALFS (spec bd942ca0)" means that protocol. The live entries
`fj.frame.v3` and `ap.headReachesLo.v5` pin `alfs4`. The intermediate
version a3e12c57 (r163's edit, which deleted blocks from Σ.T; sha256
`a3e12c57e63f010b49b01d0935d150bbc95f884dcd456505f602f11efe55bf98`) is
archived as `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-a3e12c57.tex` as history only.
No entry pins it.

FG-SA sources (registered 2026-09-29). `fgsa1` is the FG-SA spec (plain SA
available chain + DC finality gadget, FJ root rule only), registered from
its archive copy; a pin to it names the file `fgsa-protocol-2e884811.tex`.
The FG-SA Lean model (branch `fgsa-composition`) anchors its docstring
spec lines to this file. `fgsa2` is the adopted FG-SA spec (weak healing
and finality premises, H2′, the section "Leak identification"), registered
from its archive copy; a pin to it names the file
`fgsa-protocol-dbcb7f05.tex`. Its protocol section, preamble and Relay
paragraph are byte-identical to `fgsa1`; the change record is
`spec/archive/CHANGES-2e884811-to-dbcb7f05.md`. New recovery and leak ids
pin `fgsa2`. The live FG entries keep their pins (`alfs4`, `spec`); no
entry is re-pinned.

Note (2026-09-28): `spec/fgsa-protocol.tex` is not tracked in Git. It
changed after registration (sha256 then
`bc093836f57fd6decbf5d743afa0c4b14061d3e589e1cef83d58708ae35fec10`: `R ≥ 2`
as a parameter, a latency sentence and the δ_t range, which moved later
lines by +5). Every spec pin and spec line number in this registry refers
to the registered version `ae4497ab…`, archived as
`spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-ae4497ab.tex` (sha256
`ae4497abc7c5b3a6f73697f341bf730a63c7d34bd2f7546154bd022bc95af223`,
verified 2026-09-28). The spec will change again (FV, r154); the pins are
not re-pinned now. A citation of the form "spec/fgsa-protocol.tex, lines
…" in an entry means the archived file.

>    Roots identify blocks uniquely. Views have the specified ancestor
>    closure. Original declared support subsets remain unchanged. A later
>    path receipt does not convert a raw-only declaration into support.

>    `[r,r+g]` contains an honest opening whose next two **slot** proposers
>    are honest. Use the rule documents' `g≥3`. The full window and every
>    gate used must fit in the horizon. Strong recurrence for first finality
>    is not used here. Neither K nor the debt parameter D enters (L).

### 0.3 Glossary: F-numbers (added 2026-09-28)

Two sources use the labels F1, F2, … for different facts.

- The blueprint F-table (bp §3, lines 290–311) numbers DC and SA facts:
  F1 honest row in each QC, F2 causal cap, F3 one justified entry per
  height, F4 finality lock, F5–F10 further DC facts.
- r148 (`fj-redteam.md`) numbers its own claims: F2 = a conflicting
  crossing of j proves that J cannot finalize (PROVED, lines 234–258);
  F3 = the converse, "retain J iff J can still finalize", is REFUTED (lines
  290–309); F4 = "no timeout at H−1" as a proxy for "J can finalize" is
  REFUTED and unsafe for liveness (lines 311–338); F6–F18 are its later
  claims.

In a pinned quote, an F-number belongs to the file of that quote. Every
"F3" or "F4" in the entries of v2 means the blueprint fact: F3 is
`fg.uniqueJust.v1` and F4 is `fg.finalLock.v1`. The r148 phrase
"finalized-crossing law" (line 226) and "finalized crossing" are also
`fg.finalLock.v1`. The FJ entry titles in §4 (F7, F9, F10, F12, F14, F17)
use the r148 numbers. r148 F2 is `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1`.

### 0.4 Named idealizations (added 2026-09-28)

- `ViewRootInj`: distinct blocks of a view have distinct roots. This is
  the collision-free root idealization, as in `fg.finalLock.v1`
  (`NamedRootCollisionFree`). The lex order `(h_j, J.root)` and every tie
  by root need it: DC's selector `pickUnique?` returns none on a tie of
  distinct blocks (Astra plan audit G03,
  `docs/audit/fg-plan-audit-report.md` lines 71–72).
  After I9 (2026-09-29), this idealization is not necessary.
  `viewRootInj_all` (`AvailableChainKitFG/Correspondence.lean`) proves
  `ViewRootInj` for every view, and `rootInjectiveOn_all`
  (`AvailableChainKitFG/Accountable.lean`) proves `RootInjectiveOn` for
  every two tips. The design: block roots are derived (`nodeRoot`,
  `epair`), the FG rows are packed into the block body, and `rowsOk`
  checks them. Thus the root is a function of the block content
  (`FGBlock.root_injective`). The statements keep `ViewRootInj` as a
  binder. The entries below that name it are marked "discharged by
  `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29)"; the history of the assumption
  stays visible.

## Index

`§` is the section of this file. New ids in v2 are listed in §7; the
ids of the f1 splits (2026-09-28) are listed in §8.

"Lean plan" is the scope of the Lean FG module (user decision
2026-09-28, §8). The module is DC-fj: DC's FG without SG and grades, with
the FJ root rule in place of NJ (FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.1). `DC-fj` = planned
in the DC-fj module (plan `docs/plans/2026-09-28-fg-module.md`);
`DC-fj (ii)` = part (ii) only; `DC-fj (item 4 partial)` = the
arithmetic of item 4 only (`comp.cut.v1`);
`none (nj)` = nj research entry, not planned for Lean now; `none` = not
needed by the DC-fj module; `—` = not an entry of the current FG-module
plan (AP-side, composite, or not scheduled). Status abbreviations
(2026-09-28, r153): "local PROVED; unif." = the local clause is PROVED and
the uniform clause is REFUTED; "impl. PRV" = the
implication is PROVED. The entry has the full dated status line. The
index shows the status under the old spec (R1 views); status lines marked
"under ALFS (spec 183f2c40)", "(spec c7c41a43)", "(spec 1c6952b6)" or
"(spec bd942ca0)" are in the entries only.

## 1. Definitions (`SimplexFG.nj` frame)

These definitions use the NJ frame. FJ has its own frame (`fj.frame.v1`,
§4); these definitions do not apply to it.

### `fg.frame.v1` — duty frame

- Variant `nj`. Source r147 §2, lines 105–119. File `fgsa-conditional.md`,
  sha256 `940e481501f8c52f57bd7110faa442b54ce4aa3bb512769a07c9b769037ea0f5`.
- Lean plan: none (nj research entry; user 2026-09-28). Not planned
  for Lean now; the entry stays as a research entry.
- Statement (pinned):

- Status: 2026-09-28 — def. This is the frame of FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.2.
  bp §1.3 (lines 153–161) has the same frame; there the F test follows from
  the Z test.
- Status: 2026-09-28 — SUPERSEDED by `fg.frame.v2`. The J line of v1 says
  "compatible with F_d"; DC and the spec select with `F_d ⪯ J`.
  `fg.frameCompat.v1` proves that the two rules select the same pair at
  every honest duty view. Thus every entry that uses this frame keeps its
  meaning.

### `fg.frame.v2` — duty frame (J selected with `F_d ⪯ J_d`)

- Variant `nj`. Source spec, section "Duties and handlers", `fg_frame`,
  lines 854–859, and appendix "NJ variant", lines 1408–1417 (the frame
  without a contest). The store rule `update_finality` has the same J
  guard: spec lines 731–752 and DC `update_finality`, dc lines 937–948.
  Files `spec/fgsa-protocol.tex` (sha256
  `ae4497abc7c5b3a6f73697f341bf730a63c7d34bd2f7546154bd022bc95af223`) and
  `dc/consensus.tex` (sha256
  `dc471b47a46896fe0a3df300c188fef1512f475615ce0fc0df18dbea6d2e5517`).
- Lean plan: none (nj research entry; user 2026-09-28). Not planned
  for Lean now; the entry stays as a research entry.
- Frame (registry form; it is `fg.frame.v1` with the J line changed):

- Status: 2026-09-28 — def. It replaces `fg.frame.v1`; `fg.frameCompat.v1`
  proves that both select the same pair.
- Note: the fj counterpart is `fj.frame.v1`. It already selects J with
  `F ⪯ σ[W].J` (r148 `FJ_FRAME`, lines 151–152). `fg.frameCompat.v1`
  applies to both frames. The pinned `fg_frame` lines also
  compute the FJ frame; the NJ variant (lines 1408–1417) removes only the
  contest.
- Note: spec line 357 says "compatible", but the code of lines 736–737 and
  858–859 tests `F ⪯ J`:

> _fgsa-protocol.tex, lines 356–357:_
>
> ```latex
> $(\Sigma.F,\Sigma.J,\Sigma.h_j)$ are the accepted finalization and the

### `fg.frameCompat.v1` — "compatible with F" and "`F ⪯ J`" select the same pair

- Variant `both`. Source: registry, 2026-09-28. No source file states this
  lemma; the argument is below. Rule sources: dc lines 747–748, 762–767,
  820, 824 and 838 (checkpoint heights); spec lines 361–365 and 494 (F
  basis in every duty view); spec lines 736–750 (J guard and F basis).
  Hashes as in `fg.frame.v2`.
- Lean plan: DC-fj module, partial: (ii) only, F ⪯ J form (Lean
  `fBasis_lexMax`, plan `befb5d5`). Changed 2026-09-28; the earlier line
  was "none".
- Hypotheses: R1 duty views (`env.r150` item 4; spec lines 483–495); the
  F-basis rule of spec lines 742–750; the DC chain state (bp F5: one
  height per block; the entry `T_h` is the block that entered h). It does
  not use `a≤f`.
- Hypothesis added 2026-09-28 (§0 rule (b): the rule uses the lex order
  `(h_j, J.root)` and ties by root): `ViewRootInj` (§0.4); discharged by
  `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29).
- Lean coverage (2026-09-28): Lean covers step 1 and part (ii)
  (`fBasis_lexMax`); part (i) and step 4 stay paper.
- Note (2026-09-28, ALFS): part (ii) is now proved without the F basis
  (Lean `storeControls_eq_fjControls` and `lexMax_of_candidate`). The ALFS
  spec deletes the F basis and the J carrier (`fj.frame.v2`). The premise
  `StoreInv.Fcar` (the block that finalized F is in Σ.T_F) replaces
  them.
- Statement (registry): let d be an honest duty with view V_d and current
  accepted F = F_d. Let P1 be the greatest `(h_j, J.root)` justified pair
  in V_d whose J is compatible with F (the `fg.frame.v1` rule). Let P2 be
  the lex-greatest such pair with `F ⪯ J` (the `fg.frame.v2` rule). Then
  P1 = P2. The same holds for the FJ frame: the wording "compatible with
  F" of `env.r151` (r151 line 44) and the `F ⪯ σ[W].J` test of
  `fj.frame.v1` select the same pair.
- Proof (registry, 2026-09-28).
  1. Checkpoint heights. A justified pair is `(h, T_h)` of a chain state
     (dc line 824). `T_h` is the block that brought its chain into height
     h (dc lines 747–748, 838), so `σ[T_h].h = h`. A finalized pair is a
     former justified pair (dc line 820). The only exception is the
     initial pair `(0, genesis)`, with `σ[genesis].h = 1` (dc lines
     762–767). Thus each pair `(h,C)` has `h ≤ σ[C].h`, with equality when
     C ≠ genesis. Heights do not decrease along a chain, and a non-genesis
     entry T is the first block of its height on its chain. So every
     strict ancestor of T has state height at most `σ[T].h − 1`.
  2. Part (i): if `h_J ≥ h_F`, then "J is compatible with F" ⇔ `F ⪯ J`.
     The direction ⇐ is immediate. For ⇒, suppose `J ≺ F` strictly. Then
     F ≠ genesis, so `h_F = σ[F].h`, and step 1 gives
     `h_J ≤ σ[J].h ≤ h_F − 1`. This contradicts `h_J ≥ h_F`.
  3. Part (ii): V_d holds a pair with `F ⪯ J` and `h_J ≥ h_F`. If F is
     genesis, every pair has `F ⪯ J` and `h_J ≥ 0 = h_F`. Otherwise
     `update_finality` accepted F only with `σ.F ⪯ Σ.J` (spec line 742).
     The F basis saved the J carrier W0, with `σ[W0].J = Σ.J` (spec lines
     736–739, 749). R1 puts the F basis in every duty view (spec lines
     363–365; HEAD view item 5, line 494; a full view holds every admitted
     block). If `Σ.J = F` as blocks, then `h_J = h_F` (step 1, F ≠
     genesis). If `F ≺ Σ.J`, then `h_J = σ[Σ.J].h ≥ σ[F].h = h_F`.
  4. Each candidate of P2 is a candidate of P1, so P2 ≤ P1. Step 3 gives
     `h(P2) ≥ h_F`, so `h(P1) ≥ h_F`. Step 2 gives `F ⪯ J` for P1, so P1
     is a candidate of P2 and P1 ≤ P2. Thus P1 = P2. ∎
- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (registry argument; no Lean certificate).
- Note: part (ii) needs the F basis in the view. A view without it can
  select a different pair; R1 excludes such a view at an honest duty. The
  argument reads "greatest" in `fg.frame.v1` as the lex order
  `(h_j, J.root)` of DC §5.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (a)): `fj.frame.v2` is SUPERSEDED by
  `fj.frame.v3` (spec bd942ca0: Σ.T in place of Σ.T_F, the same set;
  `update_finality` also calls `reconcile_with_finality`, which writes no
  frame input). A citation of `fj.frame.v2` here reads as `fj.frame.v3`.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — OPEN (r149 claim table line 32; r150 claim table line
  25). The proposed M1 argument is SKETCH (r149 line 33).
- Notes: r149 §4.1 PROVES source support under effective N1 and lower F
  advances. The missing step is transport of the viable tree between the
  proposal view and an R1 HEAD view with a new F basis (r149 §4.3, lines
  417–424). `ap.reach.v1` is a sufficient lemma. bp marks the same claim H16
  SKETCH (bp §10, lines 1086–1101); r149 §4.3 shows that the bp argument
  misses one case. Scope as `ap.L.fixedF.v1`.
- Status: 2026-09-28 — WITHDRAWN (audit W02). The statement stays OPEN but is
  misfiled: it states a height rise. It is refiled as

- Hypotheses: `env.r147`; a completed repair (`ap.repair.fixedF.v1`; under
  effective N1, `ap.repair.movingF.v1`, OPEN); the opening's service
  interval stays under N1.
- Service statement: from the repair on, for each honest opening at
  `p = T_r`, every honest validator has a fresh fast write of the opening
  block B at `a_r = p+6Δ`, and its source choice is B: `C_fg(i,r) = B` for
  every honest i.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r147 §5) under literal N1. Under
  effective N1 it holds once `ap.repair.movingF.v1` holds (r149 lines
  444–446).
- Kind: AP service fact (audit W02). The height of B and the row that
  the Simplex client emits from it are not part of this entry; they are
  used in `comp.rise.fixedF.v1`.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; proof r149 lines 646–677; r150 claim
  table line 18).
- Use rule (audit W03): a composite that uses this entry must prove x0, x1,
  x2 and x3 at each call. `comp.healed.v1` does this after the reset (r150
  §3). Before the reset, x3 is `ap.reach.v1` (OPEN); r149 §6 (lines 692–695)
  does not prove it.

### `ap.rowService.v1` — honest row inclusion

- Variant `both` (a proposer rule; FJ keeps it, r148 §2). Source r147 §1,

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; part of the r147 §5 proof of (L)).
- Status: 2026-09-28 — WITHDRAWN (audit W02). The statement stays PROVED but
  mixes block retention with FG entries, maturity and a rise. The block
  retention part is `ap.carrierKeep.v2`; the rest is in
  `comp.rise.fixedF.v1`.

### `ap.carrierKeep.v2` — the selected chain keeps the honest carrier blocks

- Variant `nj`. Source r147 §5 "Carriers and maturity", lines 485–486 and

  `ap.source.v1` for the opening B at p.
- Service statement: let B1 and B2 be the honest proposals at `p+4Δ` and
  `p+8Δ`, and Q an honest proposal strictly after `p+2P`, within G. By
  exact service, the parent chains of B1 and B2 stay above B. At Q, the
  branch from B2 is still selected while N1 holds.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r150 claim table line 23).
- Note: this is the local part of `comp.healed.v1`. It uses
  `comp.theoremN.v1`, so it is not a policy-uniform service fact
  (FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.3).
- Status: 2026-09-28 — WITHDRAWN (audit W02). The statement stays PROVED

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED. The support count is RULE (the fast
  admission test); the honest supporter follows from `τ > a`. bp B3 states
  the same fact.
- Kind: AP service fact (audit W02): source safety. It is the SA half of
  the v1 provenance sentence "Each such C has an honest supporter since
  `τ>a`" (`fg.provenance.v1`).
- Note: the Lean model has no separate `FastWrite` record. The fast test is
  the first disjunct of `admissionLevels` (acG line 459). A Lean statement
  of this entry must name that disjunct, not the slow one.

### `ap.headReachesLo.v1` — the AP head is in D at height at least lo

- Lean plan: — (an AP service fact; the SA instance is later work).
- Hypotheses: `fj.frame.v1`; R1 duty views; `fg.finalLock.v1` and `a≤f`
  (so that Z ∈ D, r148 lines 223–228; clean and P1 runs with `a<h` use
  the source argument of r148 §5 instead).
- Service statement: for each duty view V and its FJ frame (Z, lo, D)
  (`fj.frame.v1`), the AP head read from V is in D and has state height
  ≥ lo. This holds in every phase (gap, uncontested and contested).
- Kind (user design correction 2026-09-28, relayed by ethereum-f1): the
  FG module exports only the frame Z, lo, D and viability. Eligibility,
  the majority test, the current-slot rule, the GHOST score and the walk
  are AP fork-choice machinery. This entry is the AP obligation that
  connects them to the frame.

- SA discharge (registry, 2026-09-28). The SA walk is
  `get_head_in_tree` (spec lines 946–955).
  1. Start in D. The walk starts at the live root A: the deepest live
     lease target in D, else Z (spec lines 529–530, 938–944). If A is a
     lease target, A ∈ D by definition. If A = Z, then Z ∈ D: in the J
     case the J carrier (height H ≥ lo) witnesses J; in the F cases a
     frontier block at height H > h(F) extends F by `fg.finalLock.v1`
     and witnesses F at lo ≤ H (r148 lines 223–228).
  2. Stay in D. `ghost` moves only to children in its tree argument, and
     the tree is D (spec lines 907–908, 953).
  3. No stop below lo. Let X ∈ D with `σ[X].h < lo`. X has a witness
     W ∈ V with `X ⪯ W` and `σ[W].h ≥ lo`, so X ≠ W. Let Y be the child of
     X on the path to W. Then `F ⪯ X ⪯ Y`, `Z ⪯ X ⪯ Y` and `Y ⪯ W`, and V is
     ancestor-closed, so Y ∈ D. The parent X of Y has state height below
     lo, so Y is eligible without a majority (spec line 920). Thus X has an
     eligible child, and `ghost` does not return X.
  4. Stop. The tree is finite and each step goes to a child, so `ghost`
     returns a block. By steps 2 and 3 it is in D with state height ≥ lo.
  This uses the eligibility threshold lo in both viability and
  eligibility, in every phase. The start at the live root and the in-band
  choice by score stay AP data; this entry says nothing about which block
  at or above lo the walk returns.
- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; paper, r148 lines 223–230 and 590;
  SA discharge above).
- Note (2026-09-28): the frame side of its feasibility is
  `fj.frameFeasible.v1` (D ≠ ∅ and D reaches lo). Step 1 of the SA
  discharge uses its part (2).
- Note (2026-09-28, ALFS): the service statement and its SA discharge are
  for the view form `fj.frame.v1`. Under ALFS (`fj.frame.v2`) the walk
  starts at `live_root`, taken in the full filtered tree, and walks the
  frozen voter tree; the start can lie outside that tree. When the frozen
  domain is empty (a late contest), the HEAD returns its anchor (ldp L6,
  lines 354–356; O3, lines 544–546). This entry is not re-proved for
  ALFS.
- Note (2026-09-28): the ALFS form is `ap.headReachesLo.v2`. This entry
  stays as the view form; it is not superseded.
- Note: the weaker form "the AP does not block leaving H−1" is NOT enough.
  An AP that lets the head leave H−1 but keeps it at H−1 for another
  reason gives the N12 stall. r148 F11 tests the old band `{H−1,H}` in
  viability and eligibility with the FJ root test: the frontier stays at
  3 for ever, while FJ with `lo = H` reaches height 4:

> _fj-redteam.md, lines 599–601:_
>
> F11 — REFUTED. Here is N12 with exact receipts, starting from genesis.
> The tested variant has FJ's frontier root test, but always uses the
> old band {H−1,H}, in both viability and eligibility.

> _fj-redteam.md, lines 728–733:_
>
> Within rules with root F in a contest and one uniform witness
> threshold lo, lo=H is the least threshold that excludes every
> unsupported H−1 branch. H−1 fails by this execution; lo>H has no
> witness at all. A different branch-dependent filter could work, but
> it needs its own proof. This does not prove that every possible
> alternative band design fails.

- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (a)): `fj.frame.v2` is SUPERSEDED by
  `fj.frame.v3` (spec bd942ca0: Σ.T in place of Σ.T_F, the same set;
  `update_finality` also calls `reconcile_with_finality`, which writes no
  frame input). A citation of `fj.frame.v2` here reads as `fj.frame.v3`.

### `ap.headReachesLo.v2` — the AP head under ALFS (frozen tree, live anchor)

- Variant `fj` (its premise is the ALFS frame `fj.frame.v2`). Sources:
  ldp §4.5–§4.6 (L5, L6), lines 316–360, and §9.4 (C5), lines 695–706 and
  737–747 (file `fgsa-live-dc-port.md`, archived as
  `tsc/archive/fgsa-live-dc-port-81677672.md`, sha256
  `816776723e439f24612c409f2007c2a236bb3fa2dbde605c68516333ee4c7b38`); the
  ALFS spec `ghost` and `goldfish_eligible`, lines 978–1000, `live_root`,
  lines 1014–1026, and `get_head_in_tree`, lines 1028–1035 (file
  `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-183f2c40.tex`, sha256
  `183f2c409f03542dbdf3f9461924077437710b74720d09b32a42d3bdb3f04afb`).
- Lean plan: — (an AP service fact; the SA instance is later work).
- Hypotheses: `fj.frame.v2`; `fj.frameFeasible.v1` part (4) on the frozen
  voter tree (ancestor-closed); for clause 4, the ALFS recovery premises
  of ldp §2 and the premises of L5 (an honest proposal after GST and
  after the two-lease boundary of a phase).
- Service statement (registry, 2026-09-28). For a HEAD duty, let V be its
  frozen voter tree, (Z, lo) the store controls (`fj.frame.v2`), D_V the
  filtered domain of V, and A = `live_root` (the deepest live lease in the
  full filtered tree, else Z).
  1. If A ∈ D_V, or A has an eligible child in D_V, the AP head is in D_V
     and has state height ≥ lo.
  2. Otherwise the AP head is A (the anchor fallback). A can lie outside
     the walked tree (DC's rule, ldp lines 594–597).
  3. If A = Z and D_V ≠ ∅, then Z ∈ D_V, so clause 1 applies.
  4. After the two-lease boundary, with the HEAD's live frame equal to the
     proposer's, a fallback needs D_V = ∅, and an empty D_V needs a
     contest event in `(t_s−Δ, v_s)`: at most 2 such slots per frontier,
     at most 4 before the reset, and none after it (C5, ldp lines
     697–706). Before the boundary, a fallback is part of the initial
     repair ρ (ldp lines 737–738). The FJ producer charges these slots.
- Note on the requested form (2026-09-28): the form "if D_V ≠ ∅, the head
  is in D_V" holds under clause 4's premises, not in general. `ghost`
  returns its anchor when the anchor has no eligible child in the walked
  tree (spec lines 983–985). A live lease A outside D_V, with D_V ≠ ∅, can
  therefore be the head before the boundary.
- SA discharge (registry, 2026-09-28), as in `ap.headReachesLo.v1`, with
  the start at `live_root` and DC's rule that the walk may start outside
  the walked tree (spec lines 1028–1035).
  1. Clause 1. If A ∈ D_V, the v1 steps 2–4 apply with tree D_V: the walk
     stays in D_V, and below lo every block of D_V has an eligible child
     in D_V (`fj.frameFeasible.v1` part (4); the frozen voter tree is
     ancestor-closed; eligibility uses `band_floor`, spec line 996). If
     A ∉ D_V and A has an eligible child Y ∈ D_V, the walk moves into D_V
     at its first step, and the same steps apply from there.
  2. Clause 2. `ghost` returns its anchor when the anchor has no eligible
     child in the tree (spec lines 983–985).
  3. Clause 3. Let B ∈ D_V with witness W ∈ V, `h(W) ≥ lo`. Then
     `Z ⪯ B ⪯ W`, Z ∈ V by ancestor closure, `F ⪯ Z`, and W witnesses Z,
     so Z ∈ D_V.
  4. Clause 4 is ldp C5 (lines 697–706), with L5 step 3 (a nonempty
     domain when the frames are equal) and L6 (the three event cases).
  The start at `live_root` and the in-band choice by score stay AP data.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (paper; SA under ALFS; ldp L5, L6, C5 and
  the registry discharge above). ldp imports r156 §§4–7 (ldp lines 68–71).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — checked by r158 (M1, lines 79–95; §3.1,
  lines 242–301; §4, lines 429–515). Clauses 1–3: consistent with M1.
  r158 §3.1 is an exact read of clause 2 with D_V ≠ ∅: the anchor X is
  outside D_V, `ht(X)=2 < lo=3`, and HEAD = X (lines 280–289). That read
  is in the outage, just after a frame rise (lines 291–293). Clause 4:
  the ldp sentence that a HEAD falls back "only when its frozen domain is
  empty" (ldp lines 697–698) is REFUTED as a general rule (r158 lines
  84–86 and 643–645). The conclusion of clause 4 at an honest proposal
  after phase settlement and the two-lease repair stays PROVED, by a
  different step: the full-store witness W and the common pivot give
  HEAD = P at every honest HEAD (r158 lines 434–457 and 477–504). This
  step does not use `ht(HEAD) ≥ lo` of ldp L4/C2 (r158 lines 629–630).
  r158 charges each effective event with θ = 4Δ (lines 532–537), not each
  fallback slot, and makes no no-reorg claim for a damaged event slot
  (lines 643–645 and 649–655). Thus the slot count of clause 4 (2 per
  frontier, 4 before the reset) is not a premise of the r158 bounds.
- Status: 2026-09-28 — SUPERSEDED by `ap.headReachesLo.v3` (the r158
  form, spec c7c41a43). Clauses 1–3 are unchanged in v3; clause 4 is
  replaced by v3 clauses 4–6. This entry keeps its spec 183f2c40 pins.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — under the receipt premise: ldp L5 HOLDS
  with the exact HEAD from r160 §4.3; its justification "same votes"
  (pinned ldp line 329) is to be read as equal scores (r160 row "LDP
  L5", lines 697–698). ldp C5 HOLDS only as the corrected bounded-event
  and P1 claim (r160 lines 707–708).
- Note (2026-09-28, r158 M1): M1 agrees with the note on the requested
  form above. A nonempty frozen domain does not force the HEAD into it.

  1217–1231, the vote-merge prose 555–565, §5 row 29 (relay) 1614–1618,
  and the δ_t scope 1356–1361.
- Lean plan: — (an AP service fact; the SA instance is later work).
- Hypotheses: `fj.frame.v2`; `fj.frameFeasible.v1` part (4) on the frozen
  voter tree (ancestor-closed); the admitted-proposal HEAD vote merge
  (spec lines 1222–1223 and 555–562), with r159 §1 as its proof check
  (M-A exact transport, M-B source transfer, M-C outage retention; the
  table for P1, L1–L8 and C1–C5, lines 70–98); accepted-object relay as
  an SA run premise (spec §5 row 29, lines 1614–1618, and lines 174–176;
  r158 L1); for clauses 4–6, the Recovery premises with `R ≥ 3` and
  `δ_t = 2R` (spec lines 1356–1361).
- Service statement (registry, 2026-09-28). For a HEAD duty, let V be its
  frozen voter tree, (Z, lo) the store controls (`fj.frame.v2`), D_V the
  filtered domain of V, D the filtered domain of the full store, and
  A = `live_root` (the deepest live lease in the full filtered tree,
  else Z).
  1. (v2 clause 1) If A ∈ D_V, or A has an eligible child in D_V, the AP
     head is in D_V and has state height ≥ lo.
  2. (v2 clause 2) Otherwise the AP head is A. This can occur with
     D_V ≠ ∅: r158 §3.1 is an exact ALFS read with D_V ≠ ∅, head
     A = X ∉ D_V and `ht(X) = 2 < lo = 3` (r158 lines 280–293).
  3. (v2 clause 3) If A = Z and D_V ≠ ∅, then Z ∈ D_V.
  4. (full-store witness W) Fix a settled phase: H, the active top-J
     restriction and lo are fixed; lower F moves are allowed. At a
     synchronous label r whose duties are in this phase, every honest
     HEAD K is in D, and some full-store block W has `K ⪯ W` and
     `ht(W) ≥ lo`. Accepted-object relay puts W and its path at all
     honest readers before `v_r+Δ = e_r < z_r`. K need not be in D_V and
     need not have height lo.
  5. (settled proposal) Let b be the first proposal label strictly after
     phase settlement, and `ℓ = b+2k−1`. At an honest proposal P strictly
     after `t_ℓ`, while the phase persists, every honest HEAD is P (W and
     the common pivot).
  6. (event cost) At a fixed frontier the phases are gap, uncontested
     top J and contested top J. Each effective event costs one
     settlement θ = 4Δ, and the two-lease repair of clause 5 starts after
     it. No count per fallback slot is used, and no no-reorg claim is made
     for a damaged event slot.
- Change against v2: clauses 4–6 replace v2 clause 4 (a fallback needs
  D_V = ∅ and a contest event; at most 2 slots per frontier, 4 before
  the reset, none after). The step "fallback only when the frozen domain
  is empty" of ldp C5 is REFUTED as a general rule (r158 lines 84–86 and
  643–645). The v2 note on the requested form stays true: "D_V ≠ ∅ ⇒
  head in D_V" is false in general (clause 2).
- SA discharge (registry, 2026-09-28).
  1. Clauses 1–3: as in v2, with the c7c41a43 lines (`ghost` returns its
     anchor at lines 992–994; eligibility uses `band_floor`, line 1005;
     the start at `live_root`, lines 1037–1044).
  2. Clause 4: r158 §4, W (lines 434–449). With the admitted merge, r159
     M-B gives the source scores (lines 39–54; table rows L4 and C2).
  3. Clause 5: r158 lines 477–509 (two-lease repair, common pivot, exact
     service). r159 M-A gives the exact votes with the admitted merge
     (lines 28–37; table row L5).
  4. Clause 6: r158 lines 532–537, 643–645 and 649–655; r159 table row
     C5 (lines 95–97).
  The start at `live_root` and the in-band choice by score stay AP data.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (paper; SA under ALFS, spec c7c41a43;

  (exact block paths, §3.3; in-window vote-or-equivocation, §3.2; exact
  timely honest rows, §3.4); for clauses 4–6, the Recovery premises with
  `R ≥ 3` and `δ_t = 2R` (spec lines 1363–1368).
- Service statement (registry, 2026-09-28). For a HEAD duty, let V be its
  frozen voter tree, (Z, lo) the store controls (`fj.frame.v2`), D_V the
  filtered domain of V, D the filtered domain of the full store, and
  A = `live_root` (the deepest live lease in the full filtered tree,
  else Z).
  1. (v3 clause 1) If A ∈ D_V, or A has an eligible child in D_V, the AP
     head is in D_V and has state height ≥ lo.
  2. (v3 clause 2) Otherwise the AP head is A. This can occur with
     D_V ≠ ∅ (r158 §3.1, lines 280–293).
  3. (v3 clause 3) If A = Z and D_V ≠ ∅, then Z ∈ D_V.
  4. (full-store witness W) Fix a settled phase: H, the active top-J
     restriction and lo are fixed; lower F moves are allowed. At a
     synchronous label r whose duties are in this phase, every honest
     HEAD K is in D, and some full-store block W has `K ⪯ W` and
     `ht(W) ≥ lo`. Every honest reader has W and its path in its raw tree
     before `v_r+Δ = e_r < z_r` (r160 §3.3), and FG-admits them by
     finalized crossing in the fixed phase (r160 §7, row "redteam §4 W").
     K need not be in D_V and need not have height lo.
  5. (settled proposal) Let b be the first proposal label strictly after
     phase settlement, and `ℓ = b+2k−1`. At an honest proposal P strictly
     after `t_ℓ`, while the phase persists, every honest HEAD is P (W and
     the common pivot). At each honest reader, the participating seats,
     the equivocating seats, the scores and the eligibility of the
     freeze-plus-P merge equal those of P's vote set; the two vote sets
     can differ in votes of equivocating seats (r160 §4.3).
  6. (event cost) At a fixed frontier the phases are gap, uncontested
     top J and contested top J. Each effective event costs one
     settlement θ = 4Δ, and the two-lease repair of clause 5 starts after
     it. No count per fallback slot is used, and no no-reorg claim is made
     for a damaged event slot.
- Change against v3: the relay hypothesis is DC's receipt premise, not
  accepted-object relay (a weaker hypothesis, so a new id by §0). v3's
  proof step "M-A gives exact votes" (r159 M-A) is replaced by the equal
  counts and scores of r160 §4.3. Exact vote-set equality at an honest
  proposal is REFUTED under the receipt premise (r160 N1). The
  conclusions of clauses 1–6 are those of v3.
- SA discharge (registry, 2026-09-28).
  1. Clauses 1–3: as in v3, with the 1c6952b6 lines (`ghost` returns its
     anchor at lines 999–1001; eligibility uses `band_floor`, line 1012;
     the start at `live_root`, lines 1044–1051).
  2. Clause 4: r158 §4, W (lines 434–449); r160 §7 row "redteam §4 W"
     (HOLDS: raw witness and path transport, then FG crossing and
     fixed-phase admission); source scores by r159 M-B, which HOLDS
     under the receipt premise (r160 §4.2 and §7).
  3. Clause 5: r158 lines 477–509 (two-lease repair, common pivot, exact
     service); r160 §7 rows "redteam §4 two-lease repair" (HOLDS) and
     "redteam §4 exact service" (NEEDS-CHANGE: use equal counts and
     scores, not equal signatures; exact P and ρ stay), with r160 §4.3.
  4. Clause 6: r158 lines 532–537, 643–645 and 649–655; r160 §7 rows
     "redteam §4 event settlement" and "LDP C5" (HOLDS).
  The start at `live_root` and the in-band choice by score stay AP data.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (paper; SA under ALFS, spec 1c6952b6;
  r158 §4, r159 M-B and M-C, r160 §§3–4 and §7). It is not a Lean
  theorem: the SA Lean theorems assume the stronger AcceptedObjectRelay
  (spec OPEN item, lines 1697–1701; r160 §9).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — SUPERSEDED by `ap.headReachesLo.v5` (the
  filtered base, spec bd942ca0). The spec has no raw tree, and the
  receipt premise has DC's receiver exclusion. The conclusions of
  clauses 1–6 HOLD (r161 §6.3, lines 587–613). Steps that NEED-CHANGE:
  the raw-tree transport of W (r161 row W: admission by crossing first)
  and transport and reflection on the retained suffix only (rows L1,
  L3, C1). This entry keeps its spec 1c6952b6 pins.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r162) — the reason in the status line above, "the
  SA Lean theorems assume the stronger AcceptedObjectRelay", no longer
  holds. The plain SA Lean base is on the receipt premise (merge
  `1a3f73a` in `lean/available-chain`, branch `receipt-relay`: `059669d`,
  `5d03d92`, `eec0f94`): the regimes (`Generic/Regimes.lean`,
  `Strong/Regimes.lean`) have no accepted-relay field; the public
  theorems `gridContract_from_engine`, `saContract_from_engine`,
  `fastP1_from_engine`, `sapcContract_from_engine` and
  `sapcStrong_from_engine` keep their statements and use only the
  standard axioms (`#print axioms`, team-lead); SA-PC derives acceptance
  from receipt (`AvailableChainSAPC/Proofs/ReceiptRelay.lean`,
  `receipt_acceptedRelay`). The full build of main at `1a3f73a` passes
  (3,558 jobs; team-lead, 2026-09-28). `CatalogLock --check` fails at
  `1a3f73a`: eight Catalog L3 hashes changed (`Catalog.sleepy` and its
  dependents), because `SleepyRegime` lost its accepted-relay field; the
  lock is not rewritten yet (user decision pending). The status of this
  entry does
  not change (SUPERSEDED; paper): there is no FG-SA Lean instance.
- Note: `ap.headReachesLo.v1` is the view form and is not superseded.
  `ap.headReachesLo.v2` and `ap.headReachesLo.v3` are SUPERSEDED; v4 is
  the current form.

- Lean plan: — (an AP service fact; the SA instance is later work).
- Hypotheses: `fj.frame.v3`; `fj.frameFeasible.v1` part (4) on the frozen
  voter tree (ancestor-closed); the admitted-proposal HEAD vote merge
  over Σ.T (spec lines 1276–1277 and 595–602); DC's receipt premise with
  DC's receiver exclusion of a block incompatible with F (spec lines
  169–183), and the admission-or-coverage lemma (r161 §3; spec lines
  184–190), with r160's vote-or-equivocation and honest-row transport
  (r160 §3.2, §3.4); for clauses 4–6, the Recovery premises, with `a ≤ f`,
  `R ≥ 3` and `δ_t = 2R` (spec lines 1410–1415).
- Service statement (registry, 2026-09-28). For a HEAD duty, let V be its
  frozen voter tree, (Z, lo) the store controls (`fj.frame.v3`), D_V the
  filtered domain of V, D the filtered domain of Σ.T, and A = `live_root`
  (the deepest live lease in the full filtered tree, else Z).
  1. (v4 clause 1) If A ∈ D_V, or A has an eligible child in D_V, the AP
     head is in D_V and has state height ≥ lo.
  2. (v4 clause 2) Otherwise the AP head is A. This can occur with
     D_V ≠ ∅ (the exact instance r158 §3.1, lines 280–293, is an ALFS read
     of spec 183f2c40 in which every block extends F; r161 does not
     re-run it).
  3. (v4 clause 3) If A = Z and D_V ≠ ∅, then Z ∈ D_V.
  4. (full-store witness W, admitted) Fix a settled phase: H, the active
     top-J restriction and lo are fixed; lower F moves are allowed. At a
     synchronous label r whose duties are in this phase, every honest
     HEAD K is in D, and some block W ∈ Σ.T has `K ⪯ W` and `ht(W) ≥ lo`.
     No honest receiver excludes W: a lower accepted F has finalized
     height below lo, and finalized crossing at `a ≤ f` puts W above it;
     in a top-J phase `F ⪯ J ⪯ W`. Every honest reader admits W and its
     path before `v_r+Δ = e_r < z_r`. For a source B with `B ⪯ K`, either
     the receiving F stays below B and the path is admitted, or F covers
     B. K need not be in D_V and need not have height lo.
  5. (settled proposal) Let b be the first proposal label strictly after
     phase settlement, and `ℓ = b+2k−1`. At an honest proposal P strictly
     after `t_ℓ`, while the phase persists, every honest HEAD is P (W and
     the common pivot). On the retained suffix (the candidates at or
     above the current F), the participating seats, the equivocating
     seats, the scores and the eligibility of each reader's merge equal
     those of P's vote set (r160 §4.3, r161 §6.2).
  6. (event cost) At a fixed frontier the phases are gap, uncontested
     top J and contested top J. Each effective event costs one
     settlement θ = 4Δ, and the two-lease repair of clause 5 starts after
     it. No count per fallback slot is used, and no no-reorg claim is made
     for a damaged event slot.
- Change against v4: the spec has no raw tree. The receipt premise now
  has DC's receiver exclusion, so the raw-tree transport of v4 clause 4
  (r160 §3.3) is replaced by admission of W by finalized crossing and by
  admission-or-coverage for sources (r161 §3 and §6.2; r161 §6.3 row W:
  NEEDS-CHANGE, "Prove receiver admission of W by crossing first"). Score
  equality in clause 5 is restricted to the retained suffix. The
  hypotheses change (a new id by §0). The conclusions of clauses 1–6
  are those of v4.
- SA discharge (registry, 2026-09-28).
  1. Clauses 1–3: as in v4, with the bd942ca0 lines (`ghost` and
     eligibility, lines 1038–1060; the start at `live_root`,
     lines 1088–1095).
  2. Clause 4: r158 §4, W (lines 434–449); r161 §6.2, lines 552–565
     (admission of W by crossing, then admission-or-coverage); r161 §6.3
     rows L4 and W.
  3. Clause 5: r158 lines 477–509 (two-lease repair, common pivot, exact
     service); r161 §6.2, lines 567–585 (source histories, the retained
     suffix, exact HEAD P); r160 §4.3; r161 §6.3 rows L1, L3, L5, C1, C2.
  4. Clause 6: r158 lines 532–537, 643–645 and 649–655; r161 §6.3 rows L6
     and C5; spec lines 1543–1545 (the empty-frozen-domain case stays in
     the event-settlement allowance).
  The start at `live_root` and the in-band choice by score stay AP data.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (paper; SA under ALFS, spec bd942ca0;
  r158 §4, r160 §§3–4, r161 §§3 and 6). It is not a Lean theorem: there
  is no checked mixed FG-SA Lean instance (spec OPEN items, lines
  1845–1858).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r162) — paper, unchanged: there is no FG-SA Lean
  instance. The plain SA Lean base now uses DC's receipt premise (merge
  `1a3f73a`; see `ap.headReachesLo.v4`). Plain SA has no F, so its
  receipt premise has no receiver exclusion; the receiver exclusion of
  this entry's premise is an FG-SA part.
- Note: `ap.headReachesLo.v1` is the view form and is not superseded.
  `ap.headReachesLo.v2`, `v3` and `v4` are SUPERSEDED; v5 is the current
  form.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — SUPERSEDED (audit W02 split, agreed with
  ethereum-f1). The statement mixes a pure FG fact, an SA fact and the
  Simplex source rule. Successors: `fg.provenance.v2` (pure FG),

  `comp.provenance.v1` (the source C is the signer's `C_fg`). Their

- Lean plan: DC-fj module (user 2026-09-28).
- Hypotheses: `q_F > a` (from `a≤f`); honest identities do not
  equivocate; the DC height-pair and finality-pair rules of r143 §3.3.
- Statement (registry): (1) every target, progress or finality QC has an
  honest row, since `q_F > a`. (2) An honest height row names the entry
  `T = σ[C].T_h` of the signer's source C, so `T ⪯ C`. (3) A finality row
  names the justified pair `(h_j, J)` of the signer's head state; hence a
  finality QC names an already justified entry, with an earlier target
  QC. The statement does not say how C is chosen or supported.

- Hypotheses: `fg.provenance.v2` (each crossing and each target QC has an
  honest row); the honest DC client (a row names its source's own height).
- Statement (registry): (a) an honest row of height h, emitted by v at
  time t, has `h ≤` the archival maximum of v's store before t. (b) Let M
  be a height. A carrier whose honest rows all have height at most M has
  height at most M+1 and justified height at most M: a crossing of M+1
  and a target QC at M+1 each need an honest row at M+1. Faulty rows can
  be new; they cannot cross a height alone. The cap does not bound a
  carrier that uses a new honest row above M.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — LEAN (DC). The Lean theorem is the certificate
  form: two target quorums for different entries at one height give
  `2q−W` of E2 weight. The step to "at most one entry" uses
  `2q_F−n > a` and honest E2 compliance; it is one line of paper proof. The

  act); `h_j < h` on every chain (DC transition, bp F5).
- Statement (registry): fix a frontier m. Let J_(m−1) be the justified
  entry at m−1, if one exists (unique by `fg.uniqueJust.v1`). For an
  honest duty d with `H_d = m`, let `E_J(d)` mean "V_d holds a carrier of
  J_(m−1)". Then:
  1. `Ẑ_d = J_(m−1)` if `E_J(d)`, and `Ẑ_d = ◇` otherwise. So
     `Φ_d ∈ {(m,◇), (m,J_(m−1))}`.
  2. If `E_J(d)` is false at every such duty before a time t1 and true at
     every such duty from a time t2 ≥ t1, then `Φ_d = (m,◇)` before t1 and
     `Φ_d = (m,J_(m−1))` from t2. Lower J values, F advances in F-mode, a
     finalization of J_(m−1) in J-mode and new blocks do not change Φ_d.
  Thus the effective filter changes at most once per frontier: one event

- Returned witness (audit W09; FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.4). The base does not
  return HNI.
  1. Cut: `u_0 = a_(r_G+2)`, its inclusive event prefix, and M = the honest
     archival frontier at `u_0`; `GST+2P ≤ u_0 < GST+3P`. H is the first
     multiple of K above `M+D+2`; `H+3 ≤ M+D+K+5`.
  2. Height x > M, from the DC consumer: NJ arm `x = H`; finalized arm
     `x = hF0` with `M < x ≤ H+1`.
  3. Arm witness. NJ arm: the prefix NJ record facts F6 and F7 (nj = true at
     H before `first`; no honest lock, target record or target row at H in
     that prefix). Finalized arm: the actual finalized checkpoint F* at x in
     an honest store, with F3 (`fg.uniqueJust.v1`) and F4
     (`fg.finalLock.v1`).
  4. First row above x: r* = the least round of an honest row at height x+1,
     `s* = r*R`, its fresh fast source body C* and its entry T*.
     `r* > r_G+2`, `t_(s*) ≥ GST+2P`, s* and every later label are
     synchronous, and every honest row at height ≥ x+1 has round ≥ r*.
  5. First-transfer view facts of C*: C* is in every honest store before
     `z_(s*)` and in every honest view from its first freeze; each `q_(s*)`
     view has maximum exactly x+1; the root is below C*; every `q_(s*)` HEAD
     covers C*; `H_d ≥ x+1` at every honest duty from `q_(s*)`.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r143 C7, C8; r148 F8). LEAN for DC only (the
  DC accountable-finality theorem); there is no FG-SA Lean instance.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — under ALFS: FG accountable safety, and
  safety at `a≤f`, are PROVED (the DC certificate result; FJ, SA source
  selection and timeout maturity do not change the certificate
  implications; r158 table line 889 and lines 909–915).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — under ALFS (spec bd942ca0): HOLDS (same
  signed pairs and certificate fold; r161 §6.1 table). r161 N1 with
  `n=7, a=3` gives a concrete FG safety failure at `f<a<h` (two
  conflicting finalizations; the quorums intersect in the three faulty
  identities; r161 lines 463–466). This is outside the premise `a ≤ f`.
- Note (2026-09-28): the output-nesting clause is `comp.outputNesting.v1`;
  the "local F never retreats" clause stays here (Lean
  `update_finality_F_mono`).

## 4. `SimplexFG.fj` — FJ root rule, own frame and interface (audit W06)

FJ changes the frame rule: a frontier test, root F and band `{H}` in a
contest. It is a module variant, not a base selector. HNI is NOT the FJ
interface. FJ can keep a height-(M+1) source that does not extend an old
justified entry at M; this is a failure of HNI(M+1).(h1), while FJ's filter
still protects the source:

> _fgsa-no-nj-opus.md, lines 612–620:_
>
> **N14: NJ-free reset — PROVED.** Under FJ every step of a descent chain
> has `x ≥ σ[C].h`. So every abandoned post-GST source has height at most
> M (§3.3). Every honest row at height ≥ M+1 has a synchronous label, so
> its source is extended by every honest HEAD from its label on. The next
> unanimous batch then puts it in every S by `t_s+10Δ` (fgsa-fast-opus
> §5.1 step 7). This is Lemma R with `x=M` and no NJ. It also follows the
> proof in fgsa-adjudicate §4: the only change is its "old J at x" clause.
> Under FJ an old J at M cannot pass a source C* at M+1, because C* is a
> frontier block that does not extend it.

Thus `fg.HNI.v1`, `fg.H19.v1`, `fg.HNIb.v1`, `fg.trunk.v1`,
`fg.oneBullet.v1` (now `fg.oneBullet.core.v1`), `fg.base.finalized.v1`,
`fg.base.nj.v1` and `fg.baseSel.nj.v1` do not apply to FJ. The FJ
noninterference interface is `fj.descent.v1`, `fj.canonical.v1` (F9),
`fj.inBandLock.v1` (F10) and `fj.twoChanges.v1` (F12; now
`fj.twoChanges.core.v1` with `comp.settle.v1`); its reset witness is
`fj.reset.v1`. The `both` entries `fg.provenance.v2`,
`fg.causalCap.core.v1`, `fg.uniqueJust.v1`, `fg.finalLock.v1`,
`fg.frameCompat.v1`, `comp.provenance.v1`, `comp.settle.v1` and
`comp.cut.v1` apply to FJ. The FJ cap M
is the cap on old honest rows (`env.r148`); it is at most DC's archival
M0. r151 calls this cap μ and calls M0 simply M.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — def (r148 claim F1, exact FJ delta, PROVED).
- Note (2026-09-28): the contest test is the local witness of r148 lines
  260–270: an admitted W in the view with `h(W) = j+1` and `J ⋠ W`. By
  ancestor closure this is a conflicting crossing of j in the view, so
  `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1` shows that J cannot finalize. The converse is
  false (r148 F3, REFUTED): J can be unable to finalize without a contest.
  `fg.frameCompat.v1` shows that the `F ⪯ σ[W].J` test selects the same
  pair as "compatible with F" (`env.r151`, line 44).

  `fj.frame.v3` (spec bd942ca0: Σ.T in place of Σ.T_F, the same set;

- Status: 2026-09-28 — def (spec text; red-team pending).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — def; r158 found no issue in the frame
  functions. The r158 function audit against DC §7 (r158 §2, lines
  126–203; table lines 138–194) finds `update_finality`, `advance_height`,
  `fg_contest`, `band_floor`, `viable_tree_from`, `viable_tree`,
  `get_fg_root` and `get_filtered_block_tree(_from)` equal to DC or to DC
  with the declared FJ and SA replacements, and "No further unlisted
  executable FG rule was found" (line 203). The r158 findings M1–M3 and
  L1–L3 (lines 55–124) are not in these functions: M1 concerns the HEAD
  anchor (`ap.headReachesLo.v2`), M2 the raw-proposal vote merge in
  `goldfish_vote` (lines 186–187).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r159) — def; re-pinned in place to spec c7c41a43
  (`alfs2`). The text of all 11 pinned blocks is unchanged; only the line
  numbers moved (+9). r159 changes only the HEAD vote merge (the
  current-slot proposal scan of `goldfish_vote`, spec lines 1222–1223)
  and the prose next to it (lines 555–565); the other function-text
  change is a comment of `advance_height` (r159 lines 223–226). The vote
  merge is AP data, not a frame function, so no `fj.frame.v3` is needed.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — def; re-pinned in place to spec 1c6952b6
  (`alfs3`). The text of all 11 pinned blocks is unchanged; only the line
  numbers moved (+7). The r160 spec change is in the Relay paragraph, the
  Clean and Recovery premises, §5 row 29, the OPEN list and the
  bibliography; no frame function changed. `fj.frame.v2` has no relay
  hypothesis.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — SUPERSEDED by `fj.frame.v3` (spec
  bd942ca0). Five pinned blocks changed their text: `fg_contest`,
  `viable_tree`, `get_filtered_block_tree` and `voter_processed_block_tree`
  read Σ.T in place of Σ.T_F, and `update_finality` now calls
  `reconcile_with_finality`. By §0 the pinned text does not change, so
  the changed text is a new id. The frame controls are the same: Σ.T of
  bd942ca0 and Σ.T_F of this entry are the same set (see
  `fj.frame.v3`). This entry keeps its spec 1c6952b6 pins.
- Note: `fj.frame.v1` is the view form and is not superseded. Its
  controls equal this entry's store controls on the full store under
  `StoreInv`. The acceptance tree `viable_tree` keeps DC's band `hmax−1`
  also in a contest (lines 956–957). The spec has no F basis and no J carrier
  (compare `fg.frame.v2`, `fg.frameCompat.v1`).

### `fj.frame.v3` — FJ frame from the live store caches (ALFS, filtered base)

- Variant `fj`. Source: the ALFS spec with the filtered SA base, file
  `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-bd942ca0.tex` (key `alfs4`), sha256
  `bd942ca0bce0b4251b969a503a8c8175db87494ab93bf028e3a2303b7683dda7`:
  the Trees paragraph, lines 352–371, `on_block` 792–817,
  `fg_contest` 970–976, `band_floor` 978–986,
  `viable_tree_from` 988–994, `viable_tree` (acceptance) 996–1002,
  `get_fg_root` 1004–1011, `get_filtered_block_tree_from` and
  `get_filtered_block_tree` 1013–1025, `live_root` 1074–1086,
  `get_head_in_tree` 1088–1095, `voter_processed_block_tree` and
  `voter_filtered_block_tree` 1207–1222, the HEAD duty call 1283–1285, and
  the cache update `update_finality` 847–860. Proof sources: ldp §1 (ALFS)
  and r161 §2 (file `filtered-base.md`, archived as
  `tsc/archive/filtered-base-fd8e07fe.md`, sha256
  `fd8e07fe667afae28dee2bc9a54d6c7fc46b49f9bb268865f98818decc308354`).
- Lean plan: DC-fj module (user 2026-09-28). Lean names (f1's plan), as
  for `fj.frame.v2`: `storeControls`, `fjControls`, `filteredFrom`,
  `storeControls_eq_fjControls` (under `StoreInv` and `ViewRootInj`);
  `fjFrame = filteredFrom (fjControls V) V` is the special case.
- Hypotheses: `ViewRootInj` (§0.4), for the lex order of `update_finality`
  (lines 850–853); discharged by `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29).
- Summary (registry): controls from the live store caches (F, J, h_j,
  hmax; the contest from the full cumulative Σ.T, never a view); the
  domain filter applied to any block set; the HEAD walks the frozen voter
  tree from `live_root` (the deepest live lease in the full filtered
  tree, else the FG root), which may lie outside the walked tree. Σ.T is
  DC's cumulative admitted tree: a new block enters it only if `F ⪯ B`,
  before the handler unpacks it, and no block leaves it.
- Change against `fj.frame.v2` (registry, 2026-09-28): the pinned text
  names Σ.T in place of Σ.T_F, and `update_finality` calls
  `reconcile_with_finality` after an F advance. The frame controls do
  not change:
  1. Σ.T here and Σ.T_F of spec 1c6952b6 are the same set, as a function
     of the received blocks. Both admit B only if `F ⪯ B` at the handler
     call, with the parent admitted, and both are cumulative. In
     1c6952b6 the F test came after the raw insertion and the carried
     votes; those steps do not call `update_finality` (spec 1c6952b6,
     line 790 is its only call), so F at the test is the same. A parent
     outside Σ.T_F conflicts with an earlier F, so its child fails
     `F ⪯ B` (r158 lines 211–213).
  2. `reconcile_with_finality` (lines 862–882) writes only SA fields
     (leases, fastWrite, saved results, S). It does not write F, J, h_j,
     hmax or Σ.T, which are the frame inputs.
  3. The SA base reads the active view act(Σ) (Trees paragraph); the
     frame functions read Σ.T. The acceptance band of `viable_tree` is
     still `hmax−1`, also in a contest (lines 1000–1001).
- Statement (pinned):

- Status: 2026-09-28 — def (spec text). r161 §6.3 (lines 587–613) finds
  that the frame and cache items (L2, L6) HOLD with the filtered base.
- Note (2026-09-28): the reading of r161 §2 is DC's. r161 §2 says
  "Remove conflicting stored branches on an F advance. Physical deletion
  can be deferred, but no base query may read those branches" (r161
  lines 133–135). The spec (the authority) keeps Σ.T cumulative, as DC
  does (DC never deletes an admitted block; hmax only grows), and the
  active view act(Σ) is the removal for the SA base; a node can delete
  blocks outside the active view, and with `a ≤ f` this changes no output
  (pinned Trees paragraph, spec lines 352–371). Source of the decision:
  `research/async-resilient-committees/tip-stability/log.md`, lines 934
  and 936–937 (team-lead, 2026-09-28; an append-only log, not archived).
  The spec intermediate a3e12c57 (r163), which deleted blocks from Σ.T,
  is not this reading.
- Note: `fj.frame.v1` is the view form and is not superseded.
  `fj.frame.v2` is SUPERSEDED by this entry.

### `fj.frameFeasible.v1` — the FJ domain reaches lo and is not empty

- Variant `fj`. Source r148 §2, lines 223–230 (the "finalized-crossing
  law" is line 226). File `fj-redteam.md`, sha256
  `934fe2927f047a11e37dbe52aba9d754d5c461927f24b91902077f17459d47d2`.
- Lean plan: DC-fj module (user 2026-09-28). Lean names on
  `lean/available-chain` main `64651ad`
  (`AvailableChainKitFG/Correspondence.lean`, verified in the source):
  `filteredFrom_reachesLo` = part (1) (lines 531–540), `fjFrame_D_nonempty` = part (2) (line 602),
  `fjFrame_Z_mem_D` = part (3) (line 629), `filteredFrom_viable_child` =
  part (4) (lines 556–577). The Lean forms of parts (1) and (4) are
  generalizations of the registry forms: they hold for any controls and
  any block set (part (4): any ancestor-closed block set). The registry
  form is the special case `fjFrame = filteredFrom (fjControls V) V`.
  The plan names `fjFrame_D_reachesLo` and `fjFrame_viable_child` (plan
  commit `befb5d5`) are not Lean declarations
  (`AvailableChainKitFG/Pins.lean`, lines 189–190).
- Kind: FG frame lemma (audit W02: an `ap.*` id does not carry a pure
  frame lemma). It is the frame side of the feasibility of
  `ap.headReachesLo.v1`.
- Hypotheses: `fj.frame.v1`; for part (2) also (a) the view holds a block
  K whose chain finalizes F (the accepting carrier of the F basis), with
  `h(K) > h_F` (DC `ChainOrder.finalized_below_height`, `Chain.lean:442`),
  and (b) every W ∈ V with `h(W) > h_F` extends F (the pure form of
  `fg.finalLock.v1`, without slashable weight); for part (2) in the
  uncontested phase and for part (3), `ViewRootInj` (§0.4), named 2026-09-28 (§0
  rule (b): the selected pair is the lex-max by root), discharged by
  `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29); V is
  ancestor-closed and not empty.
- Statement (registry, 2026-09-28): let (F, H, j, J, Z, lo, D) be the FJ
  frame of a view V.
  1. Pure: if D ≠ ∅, then some W ∈ D has state height ≥ lo. Proof: take
     B ∈ D and its witness W ∈ V, with `B ⪯ W` and `h(W) ≥ lo`. Then
     `F ⪯ B ⪯ W` and `Z ⪯ B ⪯ W`, and W is its own witness, so W ∈ D.
  2. Under (a) and (b), D ≠ ∅. By (a), `H ≥ h(K) > h_F`. Gap or contested
     phase (Z = F, lo ≤ H): a frontier block W with `h(W) = H` extends F by
     (b), and it is its own witness, so W ∈ D. Uncontested phase (Z = J,
     lo = H−1): every frontier block W extends J, and `F ⪯ J` by the
     selection rule, so W ∈ D.
  3. Under (a) and (b), Z ∈ D (added 2026-09-28). Uncontested phase:
     Z = J, `F ⪯ J`, and a frontier block W extends J with
     `h(W) = H ≥ lo`, so J has a witness. Gap or contested phase: Z = F,
     and a frontier block W extends F by (a) and (b), with `h(W) = H ≥ lo`.
     This is the Z-instance of part (2).
  4. Pure: below lo every viable block of D has a child in D toward its
     witness (added 2026-09-28). Let X ∈ D with `h(X) < lo` and witness W,
     `X ⪯ W`, `h(W) ≥ lo`. Then X ≠ W. The child Y of X on the path to W is
     in V (ancestor closure), and `F ⪯ Y`, `Z ⪯ Y`, `Y ⪯ W`, so Y ∈ D.
     Pinned line 229: "Below lo every viable node has a viable child".
- Note (2026-09-28, ALFS): parts (1) and (4) hold for any block set;
  part (4) needs an ancestor-closed set, and the frozen voter tree
  (`voter_processed_block_tree`, `fj.frame.v2`) is ancestor-closed. Parts
  (2) and (3) are stated on `fjFrame` and Σ.T_F. Their frozen-tree forms
  are ALFS L5 and L6 (ldp lines 316–360), which are comp/AP facts: in L6
  a contest can leave the frozen domain empty, and then the HEAD returns
  its anchor.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r148 F2).
- Note: this is the contrapositive form of `fg.finalLock.v1` for one
  justified J: a block above j that does not extend J excludes a
  finalization of J. It is registered for `fj` because FJ uses it in the
  contested phase (`fj.twoChanges.core.v1`); the argument uses only the DC
  certificate rules, so it also holds for `nj`.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r148 F10; r144o N15).
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (b)): "finalized crossing" in the pinned text
  is `fg.finalLock.v1`, and "same-height justification uniqueness" is
  `fg.uniqueJust.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (b)): the step "In a contest, an actual head
  reaches H" is `ap.headReachesLo.v1` (AP data after the user design
  correction of 2026-09-28). Hypotheses add `ap.headReachesLo.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS: `ap.headReachesLo.v2`, with the charged
  fallback slots.
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): `ap.headReachesLo.v3`
  (supersedes v2), with θ = 4Δ per effective event in place of the
  charged fallback slots.

  (supersedes v4; filtered base, admission-or-coverage).
- Note (2026-09-28): Lean: hFJ′ (F ⪯ J′) is a hypothesis now (partial
  coverage). A later helper lemma derives it in pure form from
  `fg.finalLock.v1` and the F carrier in the view; it will be pinned to
  this entry.
- Note (2026-09-28): the clause "A lock at H would require an already
  known carrier at H+1" will be the Lean lemma
  `finalityPair_carrier_above`: the emitted finality pair is the head
  state's `(h_j, J)`, and `justified_below_height` gives
  `h(head) ≥ h_j+1`. Only the retention of that carrier in the full store
  is a run fact.

  line 783, r148 numbering); `ViewRootInj` (§0.4), named 2026-09-28 (§0 rule (b):
  "the same unique top J" compares entries by root), discharged by
  `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29).
- Statement (registry): fix a frontier m in a no-rise interval. Let
  J_(m−1) be the justified entry at m−1, if one exists. For an honest duty
  d with `H_d = m`, let `E_J(d)` mean "V_d holds a carrier of J_(m−1)",
  and `E_C(d)` mean "V_d holds a block of height m that does not extend
  J_(m−1)". Then:
  1. The effective FJ frame `(H_d, lo_d, Ẑ_d)` is a function of the phase
     of d: gap (not `E_J(d)`): `(m, m−1, ◇)`; uncontested (`E_J(d)` and not
     `E_C(d)`): `(m, m−1, J_(m−1))`; contested (`E_J(d)` and `E_C(d)`):
     `(m, m, ◇)`.
  2. Each evidence bit is false at every duty before the first time an
     honest store holds that evidence (views are subsets of stores). If
     each bit, once true at every duty from some time, stays true, then
     the phases occur in the order gap → uncontested → contested, or gap
     → contested. So there are at most two effective changes per frontier,
     one for each evidence event.
  3. Finalizations add no change: below m−1 they are below every band
     witness; at m−1 it is the same J_(m−1), impossible in the contested
     phase (`fj.crossingNoFinal.v1`) and enforced by the root in the
     uncontested phase; at m it needs a carrier above m, which ends the
     no-rise interval.
  The core does not say when the bits become true at every duty.

  (`AvailableChainKitFG/TwoChanges.lean:653`) takes `hext`, the pure form
  of `fg.finalLock.v1`, as a premise. The premise is discharged by
  `fg.finalLock.v1` at `a ≤ f` with `StoreInv.Fcar`, or by
  `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1` (`crossingNoFinal_QC`). The paper status stays
  PROVED.
- Note (2026-09-28): scope of the line above, under the corrected §0
  definition. `AvailableChainKitFG/Pins.lean` gives item 3 (ii) two rows.
  (1) "F move at m−1 keeps the uncontested phase, Z = F′, lo = m−1 and
  D" (line 376) is PARTIAL: `Fmove_atTop` derives it from extra premises
  (`m ≥ 2`, a carrier K of F′ with `h_F(K) = m−1`, `huniq`, `hext`,
  `ViewRootInj`; `ViewRootInj` is discharged by `viewRootInj_all` (I9,
  2026-09-29)). (2) "at m−1 the contested phase is impossible" (line
  381) is BY HYPOTHESIS: at frontier m, `hext` (every view block above
  m−1 extends F′) is equivalent to ¬E_C(m, F′), so this step is assumed,
  not derived. The BY HYPOTHESIS kind applies to row (2) only.
- Formal reading (2026-09-28) of "finalizations add no change" (item 3)
  for an F move F → F′ at one fixed view V at frontier m ≥ 2 (at m = 1 no
  change can act):
  (i) if `h(F′) < m−1` and every W ∈ V with `h(W) > h(F′)` extends F′
  (`fg.finalLock.v1`, pure form), then the phase, lo, and Z up to
  F → F′ are unchanged; (j, J) is unchanged if j = m−1 (in the gap phase
  the lex-max pair below m−1 may change, which does not act); and
  `D_new = {B ∈ D_old : F′ ⪯ B}`. (Correction 2026-09-28: the first text
  said "(j, J) unchanged" without the condition j = m−1.) Every removed block is an
  ancestor of F′: its witness W has `h(W) ≥ lo ≥ m−1 > h(F′)`, so
  `F′ ⪯ W`, and B ⪯ W makes B and F′ comparable. This is "a common prefix
  below every band witness"; it is NOT "D unchanged".
  (ii) If `h(F′) = m−1` and ∃ K ∈ V with `σ[K].F = F′` (a carrier of F′
  in the view), then F′ is the unique top J (`fg.uniqueJust.v1`), and the
  phase is not gap: K's chain has `h_F = m−1 ≤ h_j < h(K) ≤ m`, so K
  carries the justified entry at m−1, which is F′. The contested phase is
  impossible (`fj.crossingNoFinal.v1`). In the uncontested phase
  Z = J = F′, so D is unchanged. Without the carrier hypothesis, (ii)
  does not cover the gap phase: a witness at height exactly m−1 that does
  not extend F′ can leave D, because `fg.finalLock.v1` needs
  `h(W) > h(F′)` (G02, line 69). The F basis puts the carrier in later
  views, which is a view change. (Revision 2026-09-28: `m ≥ 2` and the
  carrier hypothesis of (ii) added.)
  Source: the Astra plan audit, G02, which refuted "D unchanged" with a
  4-validator example (file
  `lean/available-chain/docs/audit/fg-plan-audit-report.md`, lines 60–69,
  commit `ea8ca7e`, sha256
  `c57a50e7e863139073c7d27b9688903550f21f3ba8fde0b0e3c006771ed11813`).
  r153 breaks this count only through view changes (a lower F advance adds
  an F-basis witness to later views), not at a fixed view.
- Note (2026-09-28, ALFS): case (i) is `Fmove_filtered` for any block set
  (ldp §9.3 (1), lines 630–659, claim C1); `Fmove_below` and
  `Fmove_atTop` are its `fjFrame` special cases.
- Note: the count is for settled phases, not for raw successive R1 duty
  frames (r148 F13, REFUTED; r151 line 24). Between an evidence event and
  its settling, duties can disagree on the phase.
- Composition: with `comp.settle.v1`, each evidence bit is true at every
  duty from (first store time)+θ, or +P in r148's margin. This gives the
  full r148 F12 count.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r148 F7; r144o N13).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (ldp) — under ALFS (spec 183f2c40): clean safety, 6Δ service and
  fast and slow P1 for all `a<h` are PROVED (paper) with the original
  constants (L8, ldp lines 41 and 378–394; §10.3, lines 849–857). The r157
  outage execution (r157 lines 5–10, §3) is REFUTED as an attack on ALFS:
  r157 takes the lease start from the HEAD tree's domain, ALFS from the
  full live domain (ldp lines 749–758).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — under ALFS (spec 183f2c40), independently
  checked by r158: clean chain safety, monotone S, 6Δ inclusion, fast P1
  with lag 4Δ and slow P1 with lag `L−3Δ`, for all `a<h`, are PROVED
  (paper) (r158 §5, lines 560–613; table lines 885–887). r158 replaces
  the count `h>2a` of ldp §10 by a count that needs only `a<h` (L2, lines
  72–73 and 562–572). The proof uses no FG safety theorem that needs
  `a≤f` (line 595). r158 §3.1 replays the r157 outage under ALFS: the two
  honest groups keep B to the outage end (lines 295–301). P1 under a
  view-domain anchor stays REFUTED (a different rule; table line 888).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r159) — under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): P1 and L8
  hold with the admitted merge (r159 M-C, lines 56–65; table lines 74
  and 88); the spec cites r158 §5 and r159 §1 (spec lines 1432–1440).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — under ALFS (spec 1c6952b6, receipt premise):
  HOLDS. Clean origin and P1 hold (r160 lines 675–676 and 703). The
  clean proposal comparison NEEDS-CHANGE: replace exact vote sets by
  r160 §4.3; clean safety and 6Δ inclusion still HOLD (lines 677–678).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — under ALFS (spec bd942ca0, filtered base):
  HOLDS for all `a<h`, with the complete healthy-prefix premises and
  the original constants (r161 §4, lines 227–374; spec lines 1494–1520
  and 1585–1593). An S read whose origin is an F assignment is traced to
  its earlier honest fast source, so the arming lag does not change
  (r161 lines 311–314). A local lease formed under an asynchronous prefix
  is not P1-armed (`comp.leaseVsFinal.v1`).

- Hypotheses: `env.r148`; `fj.canonical.v1`; `fj.inBandLock.v1`;
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`; `comp.settle.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (a)): `fj.twoChanges.v1` was replaced by
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1` and `comp.settle.v1`. The cut `u0` and M0 of the
  witness are `comp.cut.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (b)): the contested-band producer of r148
  §9 (lines 820–828: "the proposer parent has height at least lo") uses
  the head in band. That step is `ap.headReachesLo.v1` (AP data after the
  user design correction of 2026-09-28). Hypotheses add
  `ap.headReachesLo.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS: `ap.headReachesLo.v2`, with the charged
  fallback slots.
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): `ap.headReachesLo.v3`
  (supersedes v2), with θ = 4Δ per effective event in place of the
  charged fallback slots.
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS (spec 1c6952b6): `ap.headReachesLo.v4`
  (supersedes v3; DC's receipt premise in place of accepted-object
  relay).
- Note (2026-09-28): under ALFS (spec bd942ca0): `ap.headReachesLo.v5`
  (supersedes v4; filtered base, admission-or-coverage).
- Returned witness (audit W09): the caps M ≤ M0 and the cut `u0`
  (`env.r148`); an honest row at height ≥ M0+1 > M by `B_R`; its fresh
  source, permanent by `fj.canonical.v1` from its transfer HEAD; the repair
  start and `B_base`. FJ has no NJ arm. An actual finalized checkpoint F*
  above the cut can serve as an earlier reset (r148 §5, lines 471–475).

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r148 F14, paper bounds at the level of the
  adjudicated r143 producer). Example (`R=3, k=2, G=8Δ, g=3`):
  `B_R = 1476Δ`, `B_base = 1518Δ` (r148 §11, lines 988–989).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r153) — the uniform (M-independent) bounds `B_R`
  and `B_base` of this entry are REFUTED under the current rules. r153 (`fj-reach.md`, lines 6–18 and 24–28)
  gives a legal execution with no height rise for any fixed λ; r153a (`fj-reach-adjudicate.md`,
  lines 6–11 and 31–33) confirms it. The broken steps are r148 F12, lines
  781–782, and F14, lines 824–832: a lower F advance adds a view-dependent
  viability witness to HEAD views through the F basis (spec lines 742–749
  and 494; r153a lines 13–19 and 243–269). The reset witness
  (`fj.reset.v1`) and the local results from an actual reset stay PROVED
  (r153a lines 34 and 281–286). The valid arrival bound is M-dependent
  (`fj.rise.fixedF.v1`).
- Note: r144o N17 (lines 645–677) marks the same bounds SKETCH, because the
  contested-band producer port was missing. r148 §9 supplies that port. This
  entry does not discharge HNI (§4 introduction).
- Note (r151): the reset witness is now pinned as `fj.reset.v1`. This
  entry keeps the supplied arrival `B_R` and handoff `B_base`; r151
  §5.4 uses `B_R` as the supplied uniform producer.

  it uses `B_R` (r153a lines 38 and 466–469). The r148 expression
  `B_first = B_base+(g+2)P+9Δ` pinned here is REFUTED as a uniform bound
  for the same reason. The M-dependent form `B_lit+gP+9Δ` is PROVED
  relative to r147 (r153a line 470). Under the fix candidate FV (§8) the
  1541Δ form is SKETCH (r153a line 471).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (ldp) — under ALFS (spec 183f2c40): first finality before
  `GST+B+gP+9Δ` = 1049Δ is PROVED (paper) (ldp lines 44 and 515; r152

  finality before `GST+1049Δ` is PROVED (paper) (Theorem H plus FF5;

  `GST+B′+gP+9Δ` = `GST+1041Δ` is PROVED (paper) (lines 788–794; table
  line 899). This replaces "not independently checked" in the ldp line.
  r158 checks the slice `R≥3, δ_t=2R` (lines 112–116); `R=2` and other
  δ_t are OPEN (line 900). The weak recurrence does not replace the three
  openings (line 747).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r159) — under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): FF1–FF7 hold

  `δ_t < 2R` and `R = 2` stay OPEN.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — under ALFS (spec 1c6952b6, receipt premise):

  premise and the exact honest-row corollary (r160 §3.1, §3.4; line 725).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — under ALFS (spec bd942ca0, filtered base):
  HOLDS. FF1–FF7 keep their endpoints; the FF4 carrier extends the
  receiving F by the height cap and crossing (r161 lines 646–652); first
  finality before 1041Δ (r161 lines 656–664; spec lines 1616–1618).

**FJ composite entries (`Kit.Compose`, from r151).** r151 renames the
caps. Its μ is the old-source cap that r148 and r144o call M. Its M is

  first-transfer view facts at `q_b`: every freeze `z_b` has the C* path,
  each transfer frame has H = M+1, and C* is kept. FJ has no NJ or

  literal (L) (r153a lines 35 and 317–329: literal N1 fixes F, so the F
  basis is fixed; r153 line 31). It is the valid arrival bound under the

- Status: 2026-09-28 — OPEN as a result from the execution premises
  alone (r151 claim table line 27). The split and arrival implication
  from effective (L) is PROVED (r151 claim table line 26).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r153) — effective (L) for the FJ frame is REFUTED
  under the current rules: r153 (`fj-reach.md`, lines 6–18 and 24–28); r153a (`fj-reach-adjudicate.md`, lines 6–11 and 30: no finite

  `λ = ρ+2σ` is PROVED (paper) in the DC form (C3, ldp lines 57 and

  results, not independently checked (ldp lines 68–71 and 527–531). The REFUTED lines
  for the old spec stay.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — under ALFS, independently checked by r158:
  effective (L) (C3) is PROVED after the witness repair W (r158 table
  line 641; §4, lines 429–558). The count does not depend on M, on old
  private stock or on lower F advances (lines 553–558).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r159) — under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): C3 holds with

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r151 claim table line 28).

  contest (r151 lines 487–489).

  `ap.headReachesLo.v1`. A caller discharges `ht(A) ≥ lo_d` of x2 with
  `ap.headReachesLo.v1` (see `fj.healed.v1`).

- Variant `fj`. Source r151 §3.3 and §7.3, lines 241–242 and 668–669. File
  `fj-theorem-h.md`, sha256
  `16b69dba55d889b9ae20dd55b228cfd83ad22037d796c6219cdb65831718bba3`.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fj-theorem-h.md, lines 241–242 (excerpt; line breaks reflowed):_

> _fj-theorem-h.md, lines 668–669 (excerpt; line breaks reflowed):_

- Status: 2026-09-28 — OPEN (r151 claim table line 33).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (h12) — REFUTED with R1 views (the old spec):
  an exact reachable execution with `n=7, a=2, k=13, G=8Δ` has an honest S
  reorganization at `q_(s*)+G+5Δ` (h12 lines 6–10, 43–45). Not checked
  under ALFS.
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — under ALFS (spec 183f2c40), independently
  checked by r158: REFUTED. The h12 §6 execution survives the view change:
  an honest S changes from C14 to the conflicting P18 at
  `1248 = q_(s*)+G+5Δ` (r158 §3.4, lines 404–427; table line 898). Local
  full healing by `q_(s*)+G+5Δ` transfers to ALFS (lines 788–791). If
  `2τ−2 ≤ n−a`, full healing starts at `d_(s*+1) = q_(s*)+5Δ` (lines
  797–798). r158 does not establish tightness for k=2 (lines 426–427) or
  an optimal bound for small L (line 800).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r159) — under ALFS (spec c7c41a43): REFUTED; the
  spec cites the r158 check (spec lines 1457–1459). The corollary
  (healing at `q_(s*)+5Δ` when `2τ−2 ≤ n−a`) holds with the admitted
  merge (r159 lines 128–129).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — under ALFS (spec 1c6952b6, receipt premise):
  REFUTED, unchanged: a relay edit does not change a prior refutation
  (r160 lines 650–653). The corollary at `q_(s*)+5Δ` HOLDS (r160
  lines 723–724).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — under ALFS (spec bd942ca0, filtered base):
  REFUTED, unchanged (spec lines 1613–1615). r161 makes no claim of
  healing at the reset itself (r161 lines 666–668).

## 5. Composite entries (`Kit.Compose`, `SimplexFG.nj`)

The first three entries (added 2026-09-28) are variant `both`. They are
the run parts of the f1 splits (§8).

### `comp.provenance.v1` — each honest-containing QC has an honest-supported source

- Variant `both`. Sources: r146 §3.1, lines 244–247 (file
  `fgsa-adjudicate.md`, sha256
  `0fe1717f6abbf0d708cada05a8a4d3e3431a530d3d5c3a65e86bf755f5642017`); r148
  §5 F7, lines 400–403 (file `fj-redteam.md`, sha256
  `934fe2927f047a11e37dbe52aba9d754d5c461927f24b91902077f17459d47d2`). Rule
  source: r143 §3.1, lines 226–237 (pinned in `ap.honestSourced.v2`).
- Hypotheses: `fg.provenance.v2`; `ap.honestSourced.v2` (the Simplex
  source rule: the row source is the signer's `C_fg`, a member of
  `FastWrite_i[s]`); `ap.fastSupport.v1`.
- Statement (registry): every target, progress or finality QC contains an
  honest row (`fg.provenance.v2`; for a finality QC, through its earlier
  justified target). The source C of an honest height row is the signer's
  `C_fg`, so C is a successful fast write at the signer, and C has an
  honest supporter (`ap.fastSupport.v1`). The row's entry T satisfies
  `T ⪯ C`. Thus every QC with an honest row has an honest-supported
  source.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fgsa-adjudicate.md, lines 244–247:_
>
> Every progress or target QC contains an honest height row since `q_F>a`.
> Its entry T is a prefix of its successful fast source C. Each such C
> has an honest supporter since `τ>a`. Finality names an already justified
> entry and thus has this earlier target origin.

> _fj-redteam.md, lines 400–403:_
>
> Every target or progress QC contains an honest row because q>a. Each
> honest height row has a successful fresh fast source, with τ>a surviving
> supporters. Its named entry is an ancestor of that source. Finality has
> an earlier justified target origin.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r146 §3.1; r148 F7).
- Note: this is the Simplex-policy part of the SUPERSEDED
  `fg.provenance.v1`. It holds for the Simplex source rule only, not for
  every policy σ (§0).

### `comp.settle.v1` — relay and freeze settle store objects into duty views

- Variant `both`. Sources: bp §4.2 item 1, lines 385–390 (file
  `fgsa-healing-blueprint.md`, sha256
  `4d643d7a6285705ef8bcef6b408b46a45d64641f0d92828b3539f8f938074318`); r149

  §8 F12, lines 763–764 and 776–777 (file `fj-redteam.md`, sha256
  `934fe2927f047a11e37dbe52aba9d754d5c461927f24b91902077f17459d47d2`).
- Hypotheses: `env.r149` (strict Δ delivery and accepted-object return
  relay after GST); R1 duty views (the HEAD at `v_s` freezes at
  `z_(s−1) = t_s − Δ = v_s − 2Δ`); the object is held by an honest store at
  a time `w ≥ GST`.
- Statement (registry): let an honest store hold an object at `w ≥ GST`.
  The object is in every honest full view from `w+Δ` and in every honest
  HEAD view at a HEAD time `≥ w+θ`, θ = 4Δ. Views are subsets of stores,
  and stores only grow. Consequences: (1) if the honest frontier first
  equals m at t_m and rises at t_up, then `H_d = m` at every honest duty in
  `[t_m+θ, t_up)`; (2) an evidence object first held by an honest store at
  t_e is in no duty view before t_e and in every duty view from
  `max(t_e, GST)+θ`. r148 uses the larger margin P ≥ θ.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fgsa-healing-blueprint.md, lines 385–390:_
>
> 1. **Settling.** Every object that an honest store holds at t is in every
>    honest full view from t+Δ, and in every honest HEAD view at a time
>    ≥ t+θ. Proof: relay gives receipt by t+Δ at every honest reader. A HEAD
>    at `v_s ≥ t+4Δ` has freeze `t_s−Δ ≥ t+2Δ`. Since views are subsets of
>    stores, `H_d ≤ m` while the frontier is m. Thus `H_d = m` at every
>    honest duty in `[t_m+θ, ·)` until the frontier rises.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; bp §4.2 item 1; r149 §3, M4).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r160) — the pinned text uses accepted-object relay.
  r160 does not audit this R1-view source (bp §4.2, r149). Its ALFS
  counterparts HOLD under DC's receipt premise: event settlement relays
  admitted certificate carriers and needs no acceptance of ancient
  standalone rows (r160 lines 673–674 and 699–700; §7, lines 741–747).
- Note: this is the run part of the SUPERSEDED `fg.oneBullet.v1` and
  `fj.twoChanges.v1`. It is a statement about delivery and R1 views, not
  about FG rules. For an object held only before GST, the return-relay
  premise gives the same bound from GST.

### `comp.cut.v1` — the DC cut `u_0` and its maximum M

- Variant `both`. Sources: r144 §2.2, lines 168–193 (file `fgsa-no-nj.md`,
  sha256 `1eaf728ffc4d56cc54fbccf581a8dffe457da02b96bd59cedb012bbf5ee1e03a`);
  bp §1.2, lines 138–140 (file `fgsa-healing-blueprint.md`, sha256
  `4d643d7a6285705ef8bcef6b408b46a45d64641f0d92828b3539f8f938074318`).
- Lean plan: DC-fj module, item 4 partial (FG module, 2026-09-28; see the
  dated line below).
- Hypotheses: `fg.causalCap.core.v1`; the action schedule
  `a_r = T_r+6Δ`, `T_r = rP`; for clause 4, `comp.settle.v1`.
- Statement (registry):
  1. Definition: r_G = the first action round with `a_(r_G) ≥ GST`;
     `u_0 = a_(r_G+2)`, with its inclusive event prefix; M = the honest
     archival frontier at `u_0`.
  2. `GST+2P ≤ u_0 < GST+3P`.
  3. Every honest height row emitted in the prefix has height at most M.
     A carrier whose honest rows all come from the prefix has height at
     most M+1 and justified height at most M (`fg.causalCap.core.v1` with
     this M).
  4. At a duty with `H_V ≥ M+2`, an old-only justification has
     `j ≤ M < H_V−1`, so it is not the active root. H_V is the duty view's
     own maximum: an archival rise acts only after it reaches the view
     (`comp.settle.v1`).
- Statement (pinned):

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (r144 claims N1 and N2; r147 §6; bp §1.2).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (FG module, `lean/available-chain` main `64651ad`) —
  LEAN for the arithmetic of item 4 only; the entry stays PROVED (paper).
  `causalCap_notRoot` (`AvailableChainKitFG/CausalCap.lean`, lines 53–64,
  verified in the source) proves: if every honest row on the chain of B
  whose height pair is a vote has height at most M (`hrows`), and the faulty weight
  is below q, then `h_j + 1 ≠ H` for every `H ≥ M+2`. Not in Lean: that M
  is the frontier at `u_0` and that an old-only justification satisfies
  `hrows` (run facts), and the link "active root ⇔ `H = h_j+1`"
  (`Controls.rootIsJ`). Items 1–3 are run facts or external (the carrier
  bound of item 3 is `fg.causalCap.core.v1` (b), `causalCap`); item 4's
  view maximum is `comp.settle.v1`. `AvailableChainKitFG/Pins.lean`,
  lines 283–300, pins this entry with these clause kinds.
- Note: this is the run part of the SUPERSEDED `fg.causalCap.v1`. The FJ
  entries call this M "M0" (r148) or "M" (r151). The old-source cap of
  `env.r148` (μ in `fj.reset.v1`) is at most this M.

### `comp.rise.fixedF.v1` — height rise under literal N1

- Variant `nj`. Source r147 §5, lines 409–429 (statement); proof lines
  435–523. File `fgsa-conditional.md`, sha256
  `940e481501f8c52f57bd7110faa442b54ce4aa3bb512769a07c9b769037ea0f5`.
- Hypotheses (audit W02): the AP service facts `ap.repair.fixedF.v1`,
  `ap.source.v1`, `ap.rowService.v1` and `ap.carrierKeep.v2`, specialized
  to the Simplex policy; the Simplex client and transition: the lock
  cases (r147 lines 451–483), `fg.provenance.v2`, `ap.fastSupport.v1`,
  `comp.provenance.v1`, row folding at the exact entry, maturity and
  consumption (r147 lines 485–507); `env.r147` (premises 4 and 5);
  `fg.N1.v1` with F and Z fixed on `[u,min(t_up,u+B_static))`; `u ≥ GST`.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (a)): `fg.provenance.v1` was replaced by
  `fg.provenance.v2`, `ap.fastSupport.v1` and `comp.provenance.v1`.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fgsa-conditional.md, lines 409–429:_

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r147 §5). r149 §4.4 (lines
  443–445) confirms that the literal-N1 form stays PROVED.
- Note: this is the statement of the withdrawn `ap.L.fixedF.v1`, refiled
  in `Kit.Compose`. It states FG progress, so it holds for the Simplex
  policy only.

### `comp.rise.movingF.v1` — height rise under effective N1

- Variant `nj`. Source r149 §4.4, lines 436–441. File
  `fgsa-conditional-close.md`, sha256
  `1ea1ccc5c944335b7e7793afe2c6675a056762e35eeaeee13ec1f6066460a902`.
- Hypotheses: `ap.repair.movingF.v1` (OPEN), `ap.source.v1`,
  `ap.rowService.v1`, `ap.carrierKeep.v2`, the Simplex client and
  transition as in `comp.rise.fixedF.v1`; `env.r149`; `fg.N1eff.v1` on

- Status: 2026-09-28 — OPEN (r149 claim table line 32; r150 claim table
  line 25). The proposed M1 argument is SKETCH (r149 line 33).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r153a) — OPEN, at risk (r153a lines 44 and
  499–505). The FJ form is REFUTED (`fj.rise.movingF.v1`).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r153b) — the at-risk mark is withdrawn: r153b §C
  refutes the NJ transfer (C5) by an integer check on r153's numbers
  (r153b lines 45–46, 53–55, 900–963; the NJ consequence is lines
  956–961). The entry returns to its status before dd2f5e7: OPEN. The FJ form stays REFUTED
  (`fj.rise.movingF.v1`).
- Notes: this is the statement of the withdrawn `ap.L.movingF.v1`,
  refiled in `Kit.Compose`. The only missing input is
  `ap.repair.movingF.v1` (r149 lines 443–450); `ap.reach.v1` suffices for
  it (r150 §5). bp marks the same claim H16 SKETCH (bp §10, lines
  1086–1101); r149 §4.3 shows that the bp argument misses one case.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r150 §2). bp has PROVED* (H10).
- Note: the row-source form `ap.S.v1` does not give this protected set. bp

  entry does not cite it (audit W05).

### `comp.healed.v1` — full healing (Theorem H) and the proved bound

- Variant `nj`. Source r150 §3.4, §4.5 and §6.4, lines 248–251, 374–392 and

  `comp.fgHealed.v1`; `ap.S.v2`; `ap.Sslow.v1`; `ap.Xplus.v1`; for the
  global clause also the literal-N1 arrival count (`comp.rise.fixedF.v1`,
  `fg.oneBullet.core.v1`, `comp.settle.v1`, the r147 §6 counts; r150 §6.1,
  bp §9.4) and `comp.arrivalNJ.v1`. It does not use `ap.X.v1`,
  `ap.repair.movingF.v1` or `comp.rise.movingF.v1`.
- Note (2026-09-28; §0 rule (a)): `fg.oneBullet.v1` was replaced by
  `fg.oneBullet.core.v1` and `comp.settle.v1`.
- Clauses: (local) Theorem H, r150 §4.5, lines 374–392: the run is healed
  from `t_h ≤ q_(s*)+2L+G−Δ`; it needs none of the arrival inputs.
  (global) r150 §6.4, lines 546–569: `t_h < GST+B_proved`. The global
  clause does not cite `comp.healedLit.v1` or `comp.healedUnif.v1`; those
  entries cite only the local clause, so there is no cycle.
- (X+) discharge (audit W03): at each call of `ap.Xplus.v1`, that is, at
  every honest proposal with slot `u ≥ ℓ+1`, `ℓ = s*+2k−1`, this entry
  proves x0 (r150 §3.2, lines 187–202: every proposal-time lease is in 𝒫 and
  on the ordinary walk), x1 (lines 204–206), x2 and x3 (r150 §3.3, lines
  208–240: T = C* if `m_u = x+1`, else the source body of an honest row in

  unchanged (PROVED).
- Bounds: local `t_h ≤ q_(s*)+2L+G−Δ`. Global
  `GST + min{B_lit, B_NJ + 2L+G−2Δ}`. Example

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r150 claim table line 26). bp has

- Correction (audit W07): the extra term over the uniform `2N(λ+θ)` is
  `(H+2−f_0)(λ+θ)`, conservatively `(3N+M)(λ+θ)` in total, not `M(λ+θ)`.
  Example (`Δ=1, R=3, k=2, G=8, g=3, D=2, K=5`): 7472Δ for
  `M=1, H=10, f_0=0`; 8502Δ for `M=10, H=15, f_0=0` (bp §9.2 table; r150
  lines 540–541). The conservative form gives 7678Δ for `M=1`. The v1
  reading `2N(λ+θ) + M(λ+θ)` gives 5206Δ and is wrong.

- Variant `nj`. Source r146 §3.2, lines 359–364 (claims 1a–1c, claim table
  lines 26–28). File `fgsa-adjudicate.md`, sha256
  `0fe1717f6abbf0d708cada05a8a4d3e3431a530d3d5c3a65e86bf755f5642017`.
- Hypotheses: `ap.armedSafe.v1` specialized to the Simplex policy;
  ArmedRetained B for Outage.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fgsa-adjudicate.md, lines 359–364:_
>
> This induction uses `a<h`, not `a≤f` and not FG quorum turnout. It
> proves clean safety, monotonicity, and 6Δ service. F and S remain on
> the same chain. The accessor is their greater prefix and is monotone.
> The changed proof follows the origin/root/parent/HEAD/guard order in
> `CleanInclusion.lean`; it does not instantiate that theorem on a
> different executable `Run`.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (FG-SA; r146 1a–1c).
- Note: it has the same source as `ap.armedSafe.v1`. `ap.armedSafe.v1` is
  the AP-side statement; this entry is its composite form.

### `comp.outputNesting.v1` — finalized ⪯ available at every read

- Variant `both`. Sources: r143 §6, lines 483–485 (file `fgsa-fast.md`,
  sha256 `8907540c5c71fe06703bc8d2ec2d30bc6cbc752a5f7577219a69196e2fd8ef37`);

- Lean plan: — (an AP accessor by construction).
- Hypotheses: none. No fault bound and no synchrony premise.
- Statement (registry): at every read, `finalized ⪯ available`, where
  `available = S if F ⪯ S, else F`. This holds by the two cases of the
  accessor. It does not give `F ⪯ S` in a damaged local state.
- Statement (pinned):

> _fgsa-fast.md, lines 483–485:_
>
> The live finality update advances F only to a proper descendant; local F
> never retreats. The accessor in §4 gives `finalized⪯available` at every

- Status: 2026-09-28 — PROVED (by construction of the accessor; r143 C8;
  r148 F8).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r158) — under ALFS: `F ⪯` available by the accessor
  is PROVED (direct two-case rule; r158 table line 891).
- Status: 2026-09-28 (r161) — under ALFS (spec bd942ca0): `F ⪯ S` holds at
  every node for every a, by the output rule (after each F advance and
  after each gate, `S := F` if `F ⋠ S`; spec lines 546–556 and 1594–1595;
  r161 §7, lines 672–681). This is local nesting, not cross-node
  finality safety and not unconditional monotonicity (r161 N1). Without
  the rule, `F ⪯ S_record` FAILS (r161 lines 460–461 and 672–674).
- Note: this is the output-nesting clause of `fg.accountable.v1`, filed
  as a composite because the accessor reads S, an AP record.

### `comp.leaseVsFinal.v1` — a local lease or local S does not survive every F advance

- Variant `fj`. Source r161 §5, N1, lines 378–482 (file
  `filtered-base.md`, archived as `tsc/archive/filtered-base-fd8e07fe.md`,
  sha256 `fd8e07fe667afae28dee2bc9a54d6c7fc46b49f9bb268865f98818decc308354`);
  the ALFS spec `alfs4`, lines 559–563 and 1596–1598.
- Lean plan: —.
- Statement (the refuted claim, registry form): after an asynchronous
  prefix, every live local lease and every local S survives every later
  accepted F advance (it stays compatible with F).
- Premises of the refutation: an asynchronous delivery prefix before
  GST, all honest validators awake; `a ≤ f` (n=4, a=1) or `f<a<h`
  (n=7, a=3); `Δ=16, k=2, L=112, R=3, δ_t=6, w_F=1`.
- Consequence in the spec (finality priority): `update_finality` calls
  `reconcile_with_finality`, which deletes the conflicting lease and
  sets `S := F` (spec lines 559–563). A local value formed under such a
  prefix does not have the healthy-prefix protection of P1, so P1 is not
  affected (r161 lines 477–482).
- Statement (pinned):

> _filtered-base.md, lines 455–461:_
>
> Before receipt, U has S=K_U and a fast lease on X, renewed at 672 with
> deadline 784. It has seen no conflicting release batch. Hence at 712
> the lease is live, yet `X` conflicts with the new F=Y. The gate guard
> does not guard `update_finality`. The filtered rule deletes the lease
> and sets S=Y. This refutes unconditional local-lease preservation and
> unconditional monotonicity after arbitrary damage. Leaving S untouched
> instead gives `F⋠S`, refuting raw-record nesting.

> _filtered-base.md, lines 477–482:_
>
> This is not a Clean or P1 counterexample. Honest X and Y votes are
> withheld across the partition for much longer than Δ before the S read.
> It fails the healthy-prefix premise, even though `a<h` at every time.
> No choice of outage arming lag repairs that failed premise retroactively.
> The n=4 execution also shows why `a≤f` alone cannot protect every local
> lease against a private, nonconflicting finalization.

- Status: 2026-09-28 — REFUTED (r161 N1, an exact integer execution;
  spec lines 1596–1598).
- Note: this is not a Clean or P1 counterexample (r161 lines 477–480).
  The n=4 execution shows that `a ≤ f` alone does not protect every local
  lease against a private, nonconflicting finalization (lines 481–482).

## 6. Invariants used by the composition (V03)

Three separate invariants, each over execution prefixes:
- clean history (GST = 0 regimes);
- post-reset source history: from the reset boundary, each source body from
  its first transfer HEAD q_s (not all pre-reset sources: old justification
  disclosure is a counterexample, fgsa-fast.md);
- armed-prefix Outage history: B only, not every later body (two partition
  branches can both extend B).

`Harmless` is stated as compatibility with the body being protected, not as
provenance of one row of a new quorum.

## 7. Changes in v2 (2026-09-28)

- W08: every entry pins its statement and hypotheses, its variant, its
  source lines and the source SHA-256 (§0). Statuses are dated lines.
- W03: `ap.X.v1` is WITHDRAWN (REFUTED, r149 §5). `ap.Xplus.v1` is
  registered with x0 and x3. `comp.healed.v1` discharges x0–x3 at each call
  (r150 §3).
- W05: `comp.fgHealed.v1` covers all fast and slow protected bodies and
  cites `ap.S.v2` and `ap.Sslow.v1`.
- W07: the fixed-F bound is `comp.healedLit.v1` (r150 §6.1, bp §9.4).
  `comp.healedUnif.v1` lists `comp.rise.movingF.v1` (effective (L)) as a
  hypothesis.
- W06: `fg.base.fj.v1` moved to `SimplexFG.fj` (§4), with its own interface
  (`fj.descent.v1`, `fj.canonical.v1`, `fj.inBandLock.v1`,
  `fj.twoChanges.v1`). HNI and its lemmas are `nj` only.
- W09: `fg.baseSel.nj.v1` lists the returned witness. Run-wide HNI in the NJ
  arm is derived in `comp.theoremN.v1`.
- New ids: `fg.frame.v1`, `fg.N2.v2`, `ap.reach.v1`, `fg.causalCap.v1`,
  `fg.baseSel.nj.v1`, `fj.frame.v1`, `fj.descent.v1`, `fj.canonical.v1`,
  `fj.inBandLock.v1`, `fj.twoChanges.v1`, `fj.armedSafe.v1`,
  `fj.firstFinality.v1`, `comp.healedLit.v1`, `comp.arrivalNJ.v1`,
  `comp.handoffBase.v1`.
- W02: `ap.*` entries state only AP service facts. WITHDRAWN as misfiled
  (statuses unchanged): `ap.L.fixedF.v1` (PROVED) and `ap.L.movingF.v1`
  (OPEN), refiled as `comp.rise.fixedF.v1` and `comp.rise.movingF.v1`,
  with service parts `ap.repair.fixedF.v1`, `ap.repair.movingF.v1`
  (OPEN), `ap.source.v1` and `ap.carrierKeep.v2` (block retention);
  `ap.carrierKeep.v1` (FG entries, maturity, rise); `ap.honestSourced.v1`
  (client and plateau-entry facts; now `ap.honestSourced.v2`);
  `ap.finalityHead.v1` (record permission; now `ap.finalityHead.v2`);
  `ap.outputRecovered.v1` (depends on `comp.theoremN.v1`; covered by the
  local clause of `comp.healed.v1`). `comp.healedLit.v1` and
  `comp.healedUnif.v1` cite that local clause; the global clause of
  `comp.healed.v1` no longer cites `comp.healedLit.v1`.
- New ids for W02: `ap.repair.fixedF.v1`, `ap.repair.movingF.v1`,
  `ap.source.v1`, `ap.carrierKeep.v2`, `ap.honestSourced.v2`,
  `ap.finalityHead.v2`, `comp.rise.fixedF.v1`, `comp.rise.movingF.v1`.
- r151 (`fj-theorem-h.md`) registered: `env.r151`, `fj.reset.v1`,
  `fj.theoremN.v1`, `fj.rise.fixedF.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1`,
  `fj.Xplus.v1`, `fj.healed.v1`, `fj.healedUnif.v1`, `fj.healedAtQ.v1`.
  r151 confirms F13 REFUTED. It does not address the Opus `B_reset`
  shortcut (r146 claim 3c stays SKETCH).
- Status changes from v1: `comp.theoremN.v1`, `comp.fgHealed.v1` and
  `fg.base.nj.v1` go from PROVED* to PROVED, because r149 proves (S) and
  (S_slow) and r150 §2 states Theorem N as PROVED.

## 8. Changes after v2: f1 registry splits (2026-09-28)

Agreed with the framework session ethereum-f1. The splits separate pure
FG facts (`fg.*`, `fj.*`) from run facts (`comp.*`) and SA facts (`ap.*`),
as audit W02 requires. No status of an existing claim changes: each
SUPERSEDED entry is the conjunction of its successors.

- §0: new status SUPERSEDED; two hypotheses-list edits keep an id (rules
  (a) and (b)). §0.1 registers `slow-arming.md` and the sources outside
  `tsc/`. §0.3 is a glossary of the two F-number systems (r148 and the
  blueprint F-table).
- `fg.frame.v1` → SUPERSEDED by `fg.frame.v2` (J selected with
  `F_d ⪯ J_d`, as in DC and spec `update_finality` and spec `fg_frame`).
  New lemma `fg.frameCompat.v1` (registry argument): the two rules select
  the same pair at every honest duty view, without `a≤f`. Spec line 357
  says "compatible"; its code tests `F ⪯ J`.
- `fg.provenance.v1` → SUPERSEDED by `fg.provenance.v2` (pure FG),
  `ap.fastSupport.v1` (a fast write has ≥ τ surviving supporters, so an
  honest one) and `comp.provenance.v1` (the source is the signer's
  `C_fg`).
- `fg.causalCap.v1` → SUPERSEDED by `fg.causalCap.core.v1` (the cap for
  any M; row bound LEAN in DC `WeakHeightBounds.lean:42`) and `comp.cut.v1`
  (r_G, `u_0 = a_(r_G+2)`, M at `u_0`).
- `fg.oneBullet.v1` → SUPERSEDED by `fg.oneBullet.core.v1` (items 2–4 of
  bp §4.2) and `comp.settle.v1` (item 1, settling within θ = 4Δ).
- `fj.twoChanges.v1` → SUPERSEDED by `fj.twoChanges.core.v1` (the phase
  count) and `comp.settle.v1` (settling within θ, or P in r148).
- New ids for the blueprint facts: `fg.uniqueJust.v1` (F3; DC Lemma U,
  `Engine.lean:243` `justification_unique_per_height`) and
  `fg.finalLock.v1` (F4; `FinalityComparison.lean:50`
  `finalized_preceq_of_height_lt`; r148's "finalized-crossing law", line
  226). Both are LEAN for DC only.
- New id `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1` (r148 F2, PROVED, lines 234–258).
  `fj.frame.v1` has a note: its contest test is the local witness of r148
  lines 260–270.
- Hypotheses lists that cited a SUPERSEDED id now cite its successors:
  `comp.rise.fixedF.v1`, `comp.theoremN.v1`, `comp.healed.v1`,
  `comp.healedLit.v1`, `comp.healedUnif.v1`, `fg.base.fj.v1`,
  `fj.reset.v1`, `fj.theoremN.v1`, `fj.rise.fixedF.v1`,
  `fj.rise.movingF.v1`. Lists that used F3 or F4 by number now name
  `fg.uniqueJust.v1` or `fg.finalLock.v1`: `fg.trunk.v1`,
  `fg.base.finalized.v1`, `fg.base.nj.v1`, `fg.baseSel.nj.v1`,
  `fj.inBandLock.v1` (note), `fj.reset.v1`.
- New ids: `fg.frame.v2`, `fg.frameCompat.v1`, `ap.fastSupport.v1`,
  `fg.provenance.v2`, `fg.causalCap.core.v1`, `fg.uniqueJust.v1`,
  `fg.finalLock.v1`, `fg.oneBullet.core.v1`, `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1`,
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`, `comp.provenance.v1`, `comp.settle.v1`,
  `comp.cut.v1`.
- SUPERSEDED: `fg.frame.v1`, `fg.provenance.v1`, `fg.causalCap.v1`,
  `fg.oneBullet.v1`, `fj.twoChanges.v1`.
- Lean scope (user decision 2026-09-28, relayed by ethereum-f1): the Lean
  FG module is DC-fj (DC's FG without SG and grades, with the FJ root rule
  in place of NJ; FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md §7.1). NJ is not formalized now. The
  index has a new column "Lean plan". Each entry of the DC-fj plan has the
  line "Lean plan: DC-fj module": `fj.frame.v1`, `fg.accountable.v1`,
  `fj.inBandLock.v1`, `fg.uniqueJust.v1`, `fg.finalLock.v1`,
  `fg.provenance.v2`, `fg.causalCap.core.v1`, `fj.crossingNoFinal.v1`,
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`. The nj-only entries have the line "Lean plan:
  none (nj research entry)" and are not planned for Lean now: `fg.frame.v1`,
  `fg.frame.v2`, `fg.Ret.v1`, `fg.N1.v1`, `fg.N1eff.v1`, `fg.N2.v1`,
  `fg.N2.v2`, `fg.HNI.v1`, `fg.trunk.v1`, `fg.oneBullet.v1`,
  `fg.oneBullet.core.v1`, `fg.H19.v1`, `fg.HNIb.v1`,
  `fg.base.finalized.v1`, `fg.base.nj.v1`, `fg.baseSel.nj.v1`. They stay
  as research entries. `fg.frameCompat.v1` is not needed by the DC-fj
  module. `fg.frame.v2` points to its fj counterpart `fj.frame.v1`.
- Open item (2026-09-28): `ap.S.v2`, `ap.Sslow.v1` and `comp.theoremN.v1`
  use `fg.N2.v2` (NJ frame). An fj Kept/N2 form with lo is a new fj entry,
  needed for Kit.Compose. OPEN.
- New id `ap.headReachesLo.v1` (variant fj; PROVED (FG-SA); Lean plan
  —). User design correction 2026-09-28, relayed by ethereum-f1:
  eligibility, the majority test, the current-slot rule, the GHOST score
  and the walk are AP fork-choice machinery; the FG module exports only
  the frame Z, lo, D and viability. The entry states that the AP head of
  each duty view is in D at state height ≥ lo, in every phase, with a
  registry SA discharge. The weaker form "the AP does not block leaving
  H−1" is not enough (N12, r148 F11). `fj.frame.v1` has a "Lean coverage"
  line (frame only). `fj.inBandLock.v1`, `fg.base.fj.v1`,
  `fj.rise.fixedF.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1` and `fj.healed.v1` add
  `ap.headReachesLo.v1` to their hypotheses (§0 rule (b)); `fj.Xplus.v1`
  has a note that its callers discharge x2 with it.
- New id `fj.frameFeasible.v1` (variant fj; PROVED; Lean plan DC-fj:
  `fjFrame_D_reachesLo`, `fjFrame_D_nonempty`; Lean since `64651ad`:
  `filteredFrom_reachesLo`, a generalization, for part (1)). It is the FG
  frame side
  of the feasibility of `ap.headReachesLo.v1`: D reaches lo when D ≠ ∅,
  and D ≠ ∅ when the view holds the F carrier and the pure finality lock
  holds. It is an `fj.*` entry, not `ap.*` (audit W02).
  `ap.headReachesLo.v1` has a pointer to it.
- `fg.frameCompat.v1`: Lean plan changed from "none" to "DC-fj module,
  partial: (ii) only, F ⪯ J form" (Lean `fBasis_lexMax`, plan `befb5d5`).
  The index column shows `DC-fj (ii)`.
- `fj.inBandLock.v1`: a dated note on Lean coverage. The hypothesis hFJ′
  (F ⪯ J′) stays a hypothesis for now (partial coverage); a later helper
  lemma will derive it from `fg.finalLock.v1` and the F carrier.
- Status updates from r153 and its adjudication r153a (2026-09-28). Under
  the current rules there is no uniform (M-independent) healing or
  reset-arrival bound (r153a line 30). New dated status lines:
  `fg.base.fj.v1` (`B_R`, `B_base` uniform: REFUTED); `fj.healed.v1`
  (local PROVED; global `B_proved` and 1496Δ REFUTED; `B_lit` PROVED
  relative to r147); `fj.healedUnif.v1` and `fj.rise.movingF.v1`
  (REFUTED; implications PROVED); `fj.rise.fixedF.v1` (PROVED, unchanged);
  `fj.firstFinality.v1` (r152 FF1–FF7 PROVED; 1541Δ REFUTED;
  `B_lit+gP+9Δ` PROVED relative to r147); NJ: `comp.arrivalNJ.v1`,
  `comp.handoffBase.v1`, `comp.healedUnif.v1`, `comp.rise.movingF.v1`
  (OPEN, at risk), `comp.healed.v1` (local PROVED; global OPEN, at risk),
  `comp.finality.v1` (SKETCH; its arithmetic uses the at-risk bounds).
  No entry pins spec rows for `B_R` or `B_base`; r153a lines 483–496 list
  the spec rows that need changes. The broken steps are r148 F12 lines
  781–782 and F14 lines 824–832 (a lower F advance adds a view-dependent
  viability witness to HEAD views through the F basis), and in NJ
  fgsa-adjudicate lines 322–325 and fgsa-fast line 704.
- Fix candidate FV (r153a §5.1, lines 333–348; not adopted): the frame's
  F comes from the view, `F_V` = the greatest `σ[W].F` over W ∈ V with
  `σ[W].F ⪯ Σ.F`; delete the F-basis arm of the HEAD view and the field
  `f_basis` (spec lines 746–749). FV closes r153 (PROVED) and keeps FG
  safety, P1, F9, F10 and Theorem N (PROVED; r153a lines 41–42). The
  restored uniform bound is SKETCH (r153a line 43). Pending r156. Note:
  FV changes `fg.frameCompat.v1` part (ii), `fj.frameFeasible.v1`
  hypothesis (a) and the F-basis hypotheses of `fg.frame.v2`; these
  entries need new ids if FV is adopted.
- §0 rule: pins to spec text resolve against `spec/archive/` by hash.
  §0.1 points the `ae4497ab` spec pins to
  `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-ae4497ab.tex` (reconstructed by the spec
  owner; hash verified). No spec text was re-pinned.
- `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`: a dated "Formal reading" note for an F move at
  a fixed view: below m−1, D loses only ancestors of F′ (not "D
  unchanged"; Astra plan audit G02); at m−1, F′ is the unique top J and D
  is unchanged. r153 breaks the count only through view changes.
- New id `comp.outputNesting.v1` (both; PROVED; Lean plan —): finalized ⪯
  available at every read, by the accessor. `fg.accountable.v1` has a
  note: output nesting is `comp.outputNesting.v1`; "local F never
  retreats" stays in `fg.accountable.v1` (Lean `update_finality_F_mono`).
- Retraction (2026-09-28, r153b): r153b §C.4 refutes the NJ transfer C5
  by an integer check on r153's numbers, and withdraws r153a's NJ claim.
  The at-risk marks of dd2f5e7 on `comp.arrivalNJ.v1`,
  `comp.handoffBase.v1`, `comp.healedUnif.v1`, `comp.rise.movingF.v1`,
  the global clause of `comp.healed.v1` and the note on
  `comp.finality.v1` are withdrawn by new dated lines; each entry returns
  to its status before dd2f5e7. The FJ REFUTED lines of dd2f5e7 stay.
- DC comparison (r153b §C, lines 797–1000): DC blocks r153 through the
  `reflect` field of `NamedProposalPivotSuffixTransfer` (DC Lean
  `DecoupledConsensusInternal/Definitions/NamedProposalPivot.lean:78`, vc
  commit `b97b902`, sha256
  `c40efd31a51227609e800466e00206c6b728662002342de7220d10f9e8029c84`):
  every eligible candidate child in the voter's frozen tree is also a
  candidate at the proposer. In FG-SA, r153 needs FJ's contest band
  (lo = H) together with the late F-basis arm (r153b lines 47, 956–957).
  FV restores `reflect` (r153b lines 987–993). The uniform FJ bound also
  needs the common-anchor link 1d (every HEAD's live-root lease lies on the
  proposer's path to its parent), which is SKETCH (r153b lines 750–751,
  767–788 and 995–1000).
- §0 rule: research sources are archived by hash at registration, and
  pins resolve against the archive. All registered `tsc/` sources are
  copied to `tsc/archive/<name>-<hash8>.md` (hashes verified), except
  r153a (`c85c0dcc`), which the adjudicator overwrote. `dc/consensus.tex`
  is kept by Git (commit `9f5ed71`).
- Plan questions from ethereum-f1 (2026-09-28): §0.4 defines
  `ViewRootInj` (collision-free roots in a view; G03; discharged by
  `viewRootInj_all` (I9, 2026-09-29)). It is added by
  §0 rule (b) to `fj.frame.v1`, `fj.frameFeasible.v1` (part (2)
  uncontested and part (3)), `fg.frameCompat.v1`, `fj.inBandLock.v1` and
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`. `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`: the formal reading
  now requires `m ≥ 2`, and part (ii) has the hypothesis "a carrier of F′
  in the view", which excludes the gap phase. `fj.frameFeasible.v1`: new
  parts (3) Z ∈ D and (4) a viable child below lo (Lean
  `fjFrame_Z_mem_D`, `fjFrame_viable_child`; Lean since `64651ad`:
  `fjFrame_Z_mem_D` and `filteredFrom_viable_child`, a generalization).
  `fj.inBandLock.v1`: a note
  on the Lean lemma `finalityPair_carrier_above`. `fg.frameCompat.v1`:
  Lean covers step 1 and part (ii); part (i) and step 4 stay paper.
- ALFS registration (2026-09-28): the ALFS spec
  `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-183f2c40.tex` (key `alfs`), `ldp`
  (`fgsa-live-dc-port.md`), `r157` (`fgsa-live-views.md`) and `h12`
  (`fj-h12.md`) are registered; the three codex files are archived by
  hash. New id `fj.frame.v2` (fj; def, spec text, red-team pending; Lean
  plan DC-fj): controls from the live store caches, the domain filter on
  any block set, and the HEAD walk of the frozen voter tree from
  `live_root`. `fj.frame.v1` stays (the view form). Notes on
  `fg.frameCompat.v1` (part (ii) without the F basis; `StoreInv.Fcar`),
  `fj.frameFeasible.v1` (parts (1), (4) for any block set; (2), (3) in
  frozen form are ALFS L5/L6), `fj.twoChanges.core.v1` (`Fmove_filtered`,
  C1) and `ap.headReachesLo.v1` (not re-proved for ALFS). Dated status
  lines "under ALFS": `fj.healed.v1` (1004Δ PROVED, paper; local
  `q_(s*)+G+5Δ` with R1 views, transfer unchecked), `fj.healedUnif.v1`
  and `fj.rise.movingF.v1` (effective (L) PROVED, paper; 1292Δ),
  `fj.firstFinality.v1` (1049Δ PROVED, paper), `fj.armedSafe.v1` and
  `ap.armedSafe.v1` (P1 and clean claims for all a<h PROVED, paper).
  `fj.healedAtQ.v1`: REFUTED with R1 views (h12); not checked under ALFS.
  The imported r156 §§4–7, r151 N/H and r152 FF1–FF7 are not
  independently checked. The refutations under the old spec stay.
- New id `ap.headReachesLo.v2` (fj; PROVED, paper, SA under ALFS; Lean
  plan —): the AP head under ALFS. The head is in D_V at height ≥ lo when
  the anchor `live_root` is in D_V or has an eligible child there;
  otherwise the head is the anchor. After the two-lease boundary a
  fallback needs an empty D_V and a contest event in `(t_s−Δ, v_s)`: at
  most 2 slots per frontier, 4 before the reset, none after (ldp C5). The
  unconditional form "D_V ≠ ∅ ⇒ head in D_V" is not registered: before
  the boundary a live lease outside D_V can be the head. v1 stays (view
  form) with a pointer. `fj.inBandLock.v1`, `fg.base.fj.v1`,
  `fj.rise.fixedF.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1` and `fj.healed.v1` have a
  dated note: under ALFS, `ap.headReachesLo.v2` with the charged fallback
  slots.
- r158 results (2026-09-28): `r158` (`alfs-redteam.md`, archived as
  `tsc/archive/alfs-redteam-f1ddd1a8.md`) is registered. It has no
  critical or high finding (lines 55–77). `fj.frame.v2`: def; r158 found
  no issue in the frame functions (index: "def (r158: no issue)").
  Dated lines "under ALFS, independently checked by r158":
  `fj.healed.v1` (1004Δ PROVED after the witness repair W; 996Δ with the
  H12 transfer), `fj.healedUnif.v1` and `fj.rise.movingF.v1` (C3, C4),
  `fj.healedAtQ.v1` (REFUTED at `q_(s*)`; local `q_(s*)+G+5Δ` transfers;
  index: "REFUTED (h12, r158)", the index now also shows the h12
  refutation with R1 views), `fj.firstFinality.v1` (1049Δ; 1041Δ with
  H12), `fj.armedSafe.v1` and `ap.armedSafe.v1` (clean claims and P1 for
  all `a<h`), `fg.accountable.v1` (safety at `a≤f`) and
  `comp.outputNesting.v1`. `ap.headReachesLo.v2`: M1 is consistent with
  clauses 1–3 and with the note on the requested form; the ldp C5
  sentence "fallback only
  when the frozen domain is empty" is REFUTED as a general rule; the
  conclusion of clause 4 at a settled honest proposal is PROVED by W and
  the common pivot (r158 §4). The r158 findings M2 (the raw-proposal vote
  merge changes scores; the spec §5 class NOTE is wrong), M3 (`δ_t ≥ 0` is
  outside the DC port) and L1 (accepted-object relay is not in the §5
  ledger) are about the spec ledger. They change no registry entry. The
  spec is not re-pinned.
- 2026-09-28, user: FJ only. NJ entries are frozen as research history; no
  further NJ status work. The r158 status lines on the NJ comp entries
  (`comp.clean.v1`, `comp.rise.movingF.v1`, `comp.theoremN.v1`,
  `comp.healed.v1`, `comp.arrivalNJ.v1`, `comp.handoffBase.v1`,
  `comp.healedUnif.v1`, `comp.finality.v1`) and the NJ-appendix sentence
  of `ap.armedSafe.v1` were removed on the same day, before any use.
  Commit `ce0eca3` keeps them.
- r159 and the spec re-pin (2026-09-28): `r159` (`alfs-fixes.md`,
  archived as `tsc/archive/alfs-fixes-4587052c.md`) and the spec
  c7c41a43 (key `alfs2`, `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-c7c41a43.tex`) are
  registered. Spec changes against 183f2c40: the HEAD vote merge reads
  admitted proposals, as in DC §7 (r158 M2; r159 §1 checks every proof
  step); the δ_t scope (the recovery, healing and first-finality bounds
  hold at `δ_t = 2R`, `R ≥ 3`; FG safety holds for every `δ_t ≥ 0`; `R = 2`
  has only the healthy pipeline); §5 row 29 (accepted-object relay is an
  SA run premise; r158 L1); the bounds 996Δ and 1041Δ are spec claims
  (`B′ = B−2L+6Δ`); the NJ appendix is removed; the marks for unchecked
  imports are removed, because r158 checked the imports. `fj.frame.v2` is
  re-pinned in place (11 blocks, text unchanged, +9 lines); no v3 is
  needed. New id `ap.headReachesLo.v3` (fj; PROVED, paper, SA under ALFS
  c7c41a43; Lean plan —): v2 clauses 1–3, plus the full-store witness W,
  the settled-proposal conclusion (every honest HEAD is P, through W and
  the common pivot) and θ = 4Δ per effective event. `ap.headReachesLo.v2`
  is SUPERSEDED and keeps its 183f2c40 pins. The five entries with the v2
  pointer have a v3 pointer. Dated r159 lines: `fj.healed.v1`,
  `fj.healedUnif.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1`, `fj.healedAtQ.v1`,
  `fj.firstFinality.v1` and `fj.armedSafe.v1`.
- r160 and the receipt premise (2026-09-28; user decision: DC's receipt
  premise in place of accepted-object relay): `r160` (`receipt-relay.md`,
  archived as `tsc/archive/receipt-relay-a64d25b1.md`) and the spec
  1c6952b6 (key `alfs3`, `spec/archive/fgsa-protocol-1c6952b6.tex`) are
  registered. Spec changes against c7c41a43: the Relay paragraph (DC's
  receipt premise; a handler can refuse, for example a third distinct
  vote of one seat); the Clean and Recovery premises name the receipt
  premise; §5 row 29 (receipt premise; the raw tree has no receiver
  exclusion; class (b)); a new OPEN item "SA Lean under the receipt
  premise"; the bibitem RR. No frame function and no HEAD merge code
  changed. `fj.frame.v2` is re-pinned in place (11 blocks, text
  unchanged, +7 lines). New id `ap.headReachesLo.v4` (fj; PROVED, paper,
  SA under ALFS 1c6952b6; Lean plan —): the conclusions of v3 under DC's
  receipt premise, with equal counts and scores (r160 §4.3) in place of
  exact vote sets. §0 decides the new id: the relay hypothesis changed,
  and the change is not rule (a) or (b); v3's clause 4 text also names
  accepted-object relay. `ap.headReachesLo.v3` is SUPERSEDED and keeps
  its c7c41a43 pins. The five entries with the v3 pointer have a v4
  pointer. Dated r160 lines (HOLDS / NEEDS-CHANGE per r160 §7):
  `ap.headReachesLo.v2`, `ap.headReachesLo.v3`, `fj.healed.v1`,
  `fj.healedUnif.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1`, `fj.healedAtQ.v1`,
  `fj.firstFinality.v1`, `fj.armedSafe.v1` and `comp.settle.v1`; notes
  on `env.r148` and `env.r151`. NJ-only entries and premise sets
  (`env.bp`, `env.r147`, `env.r149`, `env.r150`, `ap.armedSafe.v1`,
  `comp.clean.v1`) get no r160 line: NJ is frozen.
- Filtered SA base (2026-09-28; user decision: clients ignore blocks
  that conflict with finality, as in DC): `r161` (`filtered-base.md`),
  `r163` (`spec-filtered.md`) and the spec bd942ca0 (key `alfs4`) are
  registered and archived by hash. The intermediate spec a3e12c57 (r163's
  edit, which deleted blocks from Σ.T) is archived as history only;
  team-lead corrected it to the cumulative form. Spec changes against
  1c6952b6: Σ.T is DC's cumulative admitted tree; `on_block` refuses
  `F ⋠ B` before it unpacks the block; the SA base reads the active view
  act(Σ); `reconcile_with_finality` deletes incompatible leases and
  fastWrite entries, empties incompatible saved results and sets `S := F`;
  the outputs store DC's `get_stable` rule; the receipt premise has DC's
  receiver exclusion; §5 rows 2, 3/20/21, 12, 24 and 29 change. Decisions:
  `fj.frame.v2` → `fj.frame.v3` (a new id by §0: five pinned blocks
  changed their text, although the frame controls are the same; see the
  entry). `ap.headReachesLo.v4` → `v5` (admission-or-coverage and the
  admission of W by crossing replace raw-tree transport). New id
  `comp.leaseVsFinal.v1` (fj; REFUTED, r161 N1). Dated r161 lines:
  `fj.healed.v1`, `fj.healedUnif.v1`, `fj.rise.movingF.v1`,
  `fj.healedAtQ.v1`, `fj.firstFinality.v1`, `fj.armedSafe.v1`,
  `fg.accountable.v1` (N1 at n=7 is an FG safety failure at `f<a<h`)
  and `comp.outputNesting.v1` (`F ⪯ S` for every a by the output rule).
  Rule (a) notes on the entries that cite `fj.frame.v2`: `fj.frame.v1`,
  `fg.frameCompat.v1`, `fj.frameFeasible.v1`, `ap.headReachesLo.v1`.
- SA Lean on the receipt premise (2026-09-28, r162): merge `1a3f73a` in
  `lean/available-chain` (branch `receipt-relay`: `059669d`, `5d03d92`,
  `eec0f94`). The regimes have no accepted-relay field; the five public
  contract theorems keep their statements and standard axioms; SA-PC
  derives acceptance from receipt (`receipt_acceptedRelay`). The full
  build of main at `1a3f73a` passes (3,558 jobs; team-lead, 2026-09-28).
  `CatalogLock --check` fails at `1a3f73a`: eight Catalog L3 hashes
  changed (`Catalog.sleepy` and its dependents), because `SleepyRegime`
  lost its accepted-relay field; the lock is not rewritten yet (user
  decision pending).
  Registry effect: the only status line whose reason was "SA Lean
  assumes AcceptedObjectRelay" is in `ap.headReachesLo.v4`; it gets a
  dated r162 line, and its status does not change. `ap.headReachesLo.v5`
  gets a dated line; it stays paper (no FG-SA Lean instance). No entry
  becomes LEAN: no registered entry is a plain SA Lean theorem. The SA
  model file `acG` is unchanged at `1a3f73a` (sha256 `2cb079fd…`, as
  registered). The spec bd942ca0 still lists "SA Lean under the receipt
  premise" as OPEN (lines 1852–1858); the spec is not re-pinned.
  Build detail (team-lead, 2026-09-28): `lake build` on main at `1a3f73a`
  completed with 3,558 jobs, 0 errors, 0 warnings and 0 `sorry`; `#print
  axioms` for the five public theorems gives only `propext`,
  `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. Team-lead will close the spec's
  OPEN item together with the r164 red-team fixes in one spec change;
  the re-pin waits for that change.
- FG module pins (2026-09-28; requested by ethereum-f1;
  `lean/available-chain` main `64651ad`, Tasks 1–14, full build passes;
  `AvailableChainKitFG/Pins.lean` covers 13 ids). `comp.cut.v1`: Lean plan
  "DC-fj (item 4 partial)" and a dated line: `causalCap_notRoot` proves
  the arithmetic of item 4 only; the other clauses are run facts or
  external. The index Lean-plan column is wider to hold that cell.
  `fj.frameFeasible.v1`: the Lean names of parts (1) and (4) are
  `filteredFrom_reachesLo` and `filteredFrom_viable_child`,
  generalizations of the registry forms (any controls, any block set);
  the two earlier §8 lines that give the plan names have a pointer.
  Both names and `causalCap_notRoot` were checked in the Lean source.
- Lean coverage kind BY HYPOTHESIS (2026-09-28; requested by ethereum-f1,
  approved by team-lead): a §0 rule defines it, and `fj.twoChanges.core.v1`
  has a dated line for item 3 (ii) (`Fmove_atTop` with the premise `hext`).
- BY HYPOTHESIS wording corrected (2026-09-28; ethereum-f1, team-lead):
  the §0 rule now requires that the named premise be equivalent to the
  clause or its key step, and separates the kind from PARTIAL. A note on
  `fj.twoChanges.core.v1` limits the kind to the row "at m−1 the contested
  phase is impossible"; the F-move row is PARTIAL.
