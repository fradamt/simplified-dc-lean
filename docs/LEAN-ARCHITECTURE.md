# FG-SA Lean architecture

_Status: ADOPTED by the lead, 2026-09-29 (user: "don't block on me"; the
user reviews afterwards). Owner: DC-simplify (lead). §4 and §7 come from
lean-framework; §2 from fgsa-lean. Target: `docs/LEAN-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Path: draft 1 reviews (both REVISE) → draft 2 → full audit (Astra REVISE,
Opus ADOPT WITH FIXES) → draft 3 fold (§12) → delta check on immutable
copies (Astra ADOPT WITH FIXES 0/1/4; Opus ADOPT WITH FIXES 0/3/17) →
adoption. The post-adoption fixes (§13) each carry a gate. Adoption
releases the holds on T7.3+, the F0–F2 plan and 1c, in the order of §9._

_Draft 1: `archive/LEAN-ARCHITECTURE-draft1-40f3baef.md`. Reviews:
`TS/codex/reports/a0-synthesis-review-{astra,opus}.md`. §11 maps every
review item to its fix._

**Purpose.** The user (2026-09-29): get the structure of the claims right
first, then the proof architecture; decide the common proof modules and how
each part reuses generic results, so that no idea (for example a safety
argument) is proved again with small changes to its premises; start broad
work only when this foundation is solid.

This document is the index and the rule set. The detail stays in the input
files; each section names the file that it takes as authoritative.

**Authorities.** Spec `spec/fgsa-protocol.tex` **8ef4ed3b** (c1ea1db0 +
the recurrence quantifier, `Honest(s)` with s > 0, Rec_c one-way, and the
exclusion-direction remark; `spec/archive/CHANGES-c1ea1db0-to-8ef4ed3b.md`).
Blueprint 00 2e67a980, 01 200c9c07, 02 4d724984, 03 3f90c688, 21 9aec3e9f,
22 d17eef99 (tip-stability). `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the shared map); this
document adds the proof architecture below it.

`TS/` = `~/ethereum/research/async-resilient-committees/tip-stability/`,
`AC/` = `~/ethereum/lean/available-chain/`, `FP/` =
`~/worktrees/available-chain-fgsa-plan/`.

**Input freeze (review fix O16).** The audit runs on named hashes of this
document, GLY, S3, T7 and P3. From the start of the audit to adoption, no
input changes; a needed change stops the audit and goes through the register
(§8).

## 1. Principles

P1. **One statement per proof idea.** Each idea of the S1 catalogue
    (G01–G38) and each id-less idea row of GLY §B.2 (history, folds, base
    transport, property kernel) has one generic Lean statement in one
    module. A claim or a task cites it and does not restate it. A generic
    form needs two instances (GLY rule F-31); otherwise it stays in its
    lane. §3 gives the home of every idea that had two candidates.
P2. **Smallest regime input.** A lemma takes the smallest regime-facts
    record that its proof reads (`FaultQ`, `FaultX`, `Batch`, `LabelFacts`,
    `DeliveryWithin`), never a whole regime (S1 §2). The regime choice is a
    choice of producer, not a new statement (example: one T7.12 statement,
    two `DeliveryWithin` producers; one receipt core, two trigger
    producers, §5).
P3. **Claim shape.** A claim is `set → local premises → channel Prop`, and
    every `…Claim` is `∀ binders, Prem args → N₁ → … → Nₖ → Concl args` with
    `Concl` a named definition (S3 §2.3).
P4. **Typed premise packages.** Premises that depend on each other share one
    point tuple (1c M03; S3 §2.2).
P5. **Reuse class of every run-level lemma** (S3 §5): (ii) a generic
    v2/KitV2 lemma plus an instance; (iii) a store-level lemma through the
    (b2) wrapper route; transport only with a named step/handler
    correspondence; restatement only with a stated reason. An FG-SA run is
    not a Grid CO run, so no Grid CO run lemma transports.
P6. **Frozen stays frozen.** A frozen declaration does not change. A more
    general form is an internal lemma, and the frozen statement is derived
    from it (KernelP → the FGood/FGood4 disjunction; SrcFrame → CPPrefix,
    CPCompat). A generic form of a frozen lemma is a COROLLARY proved from
    the frozen core, never a second proof (L33: the KitV2 induction and
    record-fold cores, §4). A public wrapper of a public contract is a
    corollary too (QualSearch → HTimeBestStatement).
P7. **Module system first** (the user's "import trick", confirmed
    2026-09-29). Statements and proofs are separate modules; a theorem's
    proof is not exported; `private` is for helper lemmas. An ordinary
    proof-only edit rebuilds one module. Three edits are interface edits and
    rebuild the cone: a change of a public theorem's axiom set (B3b); a new
    exported equation lemma; a change to an exposed computable definition
    (§7).
P8. **Set reads only.** Claim-relevant reads use sets. No statement or proof
    compares roots, whole proposals or `fgBlock` values across two runs or
    two delivery orders (1c D5).
P9. **Zero renames in F0–F2.** New names are additive; old names stay as
    wrappers. Reasons: pin evidence names constants (`FGPinIds
    --check-names`) and other plans cite them. The catalog lock covers
    Framework modules only.
P10. **One cross-lane rule (written once here; S3 §4.2 and BUILD §7.4
    cite it; L37).** A lane `Proofs/<F>/*` and a `Proofs/Shared/*` module
    import only: statement modules, the Generic and KitFG layers, the
    upstream libraries (EngineV2, KitV2, the FGSA store, FGSARun; they are
    not lanes) and `Proofs/Shared/*`. A lane never imports another lane's
    proof modules or `Export`; it takes another lane's result as a premise.
    Two exceptions, and only these: `Proofs/<F>/Export` imports
    `Claims/<F>`; `Proofs/Assembly/<Claim>` imports the Exports and joins
    lanes. SYN L58 adds one exact aggregate-proof home:
    `AvailableChainFGSAProofs.Proofs.Assembly.Root`. It may import the claim
    facade `AvailableChainFGSAClaims.FGSAClaims`, the named lower modules
    `Proofs.Assembly.Foundations`, `Proofs.Assembly.Shared` and
    `Proofs.Assembly.Clean`, and the existing foundation imports. All global
    checks still apply. Other Assembly modules may import neither Assembly
    modules nor the claim facade. Library roots remain import lists.
P11. **Producers before freeze.** A gate freezes a statement only after
    the statements that it consumes exist and after each producer of its
    premises has stated what it needs. A LAW with an instance obligation
    freezes only after its generic proof and one instance proof exist in
    Lean (L34; two laws failed on paper in A0). The order of §9 implements
    this.

## 2. Claim structure

Authority: **S3 §2** (and §3 for the machine inventory). Summary:

- **Families and packages.** Foundation (BaseSet), Clean (CleanSet,
  CleanCutSet b₀, CleanPrefixSet b₀), Healing (HealingSet G = Recovery₂
  core), Finality (core + a named recurrence form), P1/Outage (OutageSet).
  `G ≤ P` is a separate premise where a claim states it. `RecoveryCore`
  has no δ parameter: the 2R claims take `hδ : p.δt = 2 * p.R`, and the
  general-delay claims take their own binder on `p.δt`.
- **Inventory.** 306 keys, key = (claim, clause, form); deferred rows stay
  visible (S3a r3.3 e27f013f + INV 056c8c4c). `FGSAClaims` holds only the
  exported claims; the 21 lemmas and the channel and service Props are in
  `FGSAInterfaces` (EXEMPT, "internal interface"); T1 keeps one row per bp
  id (O15).
- **Window specs.** The bodies of cleanWinAt, cleanWin, cleanPrefixWin,
  cleanLabelWin, gapWin, formWin, formWinAt, kernelWin, trigWin and
  outProtWin, and the key-to-spec map, are APPROVED (lead, O16). `outWin`:
  shape approved; its body and the final `Outage₂` fields are ONE statement
  task, owner fgsa-lean (F3 owner), before G-F0a (L27: S3 D46 holds; X11
  changes to "F3 proves; the statement is fixed at G-F0a"). Home:
  `Statements/Windows`, imported by `Packages`. `windowEnd := windowEndA`
  ("pattern end + Δ") for every constructor; the F4 owner confirms the
  values before G-F0a (O04; OD10 is then closed at G-F0a, not G-F0b).
- **Recurrence start.** Every round window starts at q ≥ 1; Rec_c starts at
  t ≥ max(GST, 1); DC's `StrongMultiProposerRecurrence` implies it (equal on
  infinite runs; the horizon guards differ by 9Δ). The start is in `RecPat`
  once; there are no per-form GST guards. `HonestSlot rho I s := 0 < s ∧ …`.
  The form-to-form implications are theorems over `RecPat` in a Proofs
  module (S3 D34–D36; `RecPat.mono` moves out of Statements, §4). Spec
  8ef4ed3b now states the same quantifiers.
- **Fixed shapes.** `FGFoundation` (F1: store, cumul, mono, frame, geo,
  strat, reconcile) + `SrcFrame Φ` / `SrcFrameAbove Φ c₀`; `CoreServices`
  (TStart, TVote, TWalk with `Batch h m`); one output-property kernel
  (GLY r3.8: `CompatOn`, `CompatAt`, `MonoOn`, `BelowOn`, `ServedOn` in Gen
  S/Pure/Props; no separate `SafeOn`) under CleanSafetyClaim, Healed, the inclusion and
  P1 conclusions, TSMono and TExact (O09); `KernelFromContract` for the
  kernel claim and F6 only, with QF2/QF4 proved from the F4 phase lemmas
  over `KernelP`; `tstarOf` + `H0.tstar_eq` and the joined kernel form in
  F0.8b (O14); `ResetArrivalStatement` and `ProgressAttemptStatement`
  frozen at G-F0b (O12).
- **Healing time (L21, replaces the premise part of L6).** The blueprint
  gives `HEALED(GST + B_best(g_h))` under the QUALIFIED-SEARCH premise, and
  Rec_c(g_h) supplies that search without implying Rec_s(g_h) (00:297–301;
  21:2970–2973). So the proof is over one contract `QualSearch g_h`
  (every aligned search from a q ≥ 1 with T_q ≥ GST finds a qualified
  round within its budget), with three producers `of_recS`, `of_recC`,
  `of_lit`, each with `hP : 0 < P` (L36). Body (L36): for every q ≥ 1
  with T_q ≥ GST and T_q + gP + 9Δ ≤ horizon, a qualified round r with
  T_q ≤ T_r ≤ T_q + gP (the "(g_h − 1)P" hint is withdrawn: it makes
  `of_recC` false). `HTimeBestStatement` (premise `Rec_s g`, horizon
  GST + B_best, B_best = min(B_heal, B_H)) stays frozen as a public
  corollary through `of_recS`. `HTimeStatement` has NO search premise; it
  is the independent general healing bound. The first-finality bound
  B_best(g_h) applies to EVERY finality form with g_h independent of g_f
  (22:1184, :1211–1213; 00:1147–1153): each FF5 alternative gets an
  optional `QualSearch g_h` premise, or a register row records the
  omission. Horizons: B_best(g_h) + (g_f + 2)P + 9Δ for Rec_F and Rec_F4
  (00:1147–1152); B_best(g_h) + γ(g_f)P + 9Δ for the strong forms
  (22:1211–1213, :1286). Owner: fgsa-lean (OPEN 7),
  statement before G-F0b.
- **Clean zero-cut (L22, revised in draft 3).** The "faulty certificate
  at time 0" attack is IMPOSSIBLE (both A0 auditors; lead check of
  Handlers.lean:45–53): no block passes admission before 4Δ, because
  `b.parent.slot < b.slot ≤ slot(now) = 0` has no solution, rows do not
  move F, and the tick at 0 runs no gate. The lead's blueprint edit
  (a < q_F) is REVERTED (00 2e67a980, 03 3f90c688). `CleanCut₂` drops the
  `quorum` field: for b₀ > 0 `a < q_F` follows from h₀ > a and h₀ + a ≤ n
  (`HealthyPrefix₂.faultQ_of_pos`), and at b₀ = 0 it is not needed. So
  `CleanCut₂` is an abbrev of `HealthyPrefix₂` and exact. The F2 internal
  lemmas take `hq : FaultQ`; only the public F2.7 `cleanCut` splits on b₀,
  with `cleanCut_zero` (one handler-side lemma "no admission before 4Δ");
  F3 has b₀ ≥ 4Δ (fgsa-lean check, audit-fgsa-items-bc9747f0.md). `CleanPrefix₂.partAt` (participation at
  b₀, OD16) stays a declared Clean-only strengthening: its claims are
  wrappers over the `CleanCut₂` claims.

## 3. Proof-module map

Authority: **S1** (catalogue, regime records, composites) and **S3 §4**
(layout), with the homes below.

- **Catalogue.** 38 ideas, G01–G38, each with one generic statement, a
  layer, a home and its instances (S1 §1). Of 16 claimed duplicate groups,
  7 are regime pairs (the regime input is the relay supplier or h, never the
  fault bound), 8 are exact duplicates and 1 is partial (R-CAP, G17). Client
  safety and row receipt get one statement each; store monotonicity has two
  (`RMono`, `RStoreCumul`; S3 D24, D37).
- **Composites.** C1 honest-batch walk (TWalk = C1 with m = n − h in
  Recovery and m = a in Clean), C2 source-bounded admission, C3 protected-B
  event step; the stage lemmas under HG.6/HG.7/HG.8a; the F4 phase module
  (S1 §3).
- **New pure work.** The suffix walk family G10/G11 (the Grid CO walk lemmas
  need a premise over the whole path, G/Walk.lean:218–221).
- **Homes decided in draft 2 (L24).** One home each; every other text that
  names a second home or a local copy is changed (S3 r3, P3 r3.4, T7 r13).

  (P10). Shared/Fold is a Shared proof module; the phase proofs stay in the
  F4 tree. G32 (`Shared/Gate`) and G20, G30, G31, G33: homes as agreed
  between lean-framework and fgsa-lean in GLY r3.11 / S3 r3.3. Justified
  local copies stay with their reason stated (T7 HEAD exclusion and HEAD
  split re-proofs: the Grid CO proof modules are outside the FG import rule;
  the T7.W and FR3 conditional re-proofs; the E-14 history restatement,
  deleted after F2; full list P3 r3.5.1 :4470–4477, :5293–5297). No
  T7-local record-fold fallback: R1 is the route, and any other route
  needs a new register entry (L33). The local-K8 fallback text in P3
  (3243–3244, 3716) is removed: T7.12 is the one K8 statement.
- **Import DAG** (S3 §4.4, with O19 adopted): Generic statements first
  (`Gen.S.Pure` → `Gen.S.V2` → `Gen.S.AC` → the new KitFG modules), then
  the FG-SA claims library. Each F0 statement module imports only the
  modules that its definitions use; modules are joined only in `Packages`,
  `ComposeStmt` and `Claims/<Lane>`. The §4.4 line is the total order for
  the acyclicity check. Claims are closed in small assembly modules
  (`Proofs/Assembly/<Claim>`), so a claim edit rebuilds only its assembly,
  1c and the tests (S4 §3.3; P10).

## 4. Generic layer

Authority: **GLY r3.11** (r3.7 + the fixes of §11 and §12 + L29–L37). Summary:

- One library `AvailableChainGeneric`, namespaces
  `AvailableChain.Gen.{Pure,V2,AC}`, each layer split into Statements and
  Proofs. Model does not change. Kit v2 closes after 1c.
- **Statements modules** contain definitions, structures and the public
  `f_def` lemmas of B3a only. Every other theorem is in a Proofs module
  (`RecPat.mono` and the form-to-form implications move to Proofs).
- **Import rules (L25).**
  - KitFG DEFINITION modules import only `Gen.S.Pure` without `Walk`.
    KitFG PROOF modules may also import `Gen.P.Pure` without `Walk` (the
    quorum core of E-5/E-6; no second quorum proof). S3 D03 ("only
    Gen.S.Pure.Quorum") widens to this rule.
  - `Gen.S.V2` may import the KitV2 modules of an allow list whose closure
    is EngineV2 only. The list has one entry now: `AvailableChainKitV2.
    ClockLaws` (it imports `EngineV2.Engine.Run` only). No second clock
    structure.
  - `Run.nthIdx?` is defined in `Gen.S.V2.Reads` at E-12 (it does not
    exist yet, so this is no rename); 1c.2's `KitV2/Canonical` imports it
    and adds no twin.
  - A locked module may import `Gen.S.Pure` (not `Walk`) and `Gen.S.V2`
    only (GLY §A.4).
  - Only `Gen.S.Pure.Walk` imports a protocol module (`GridCO.Model.Walk`,
    allow-listed).
  - Enforcement: a MODULE-LEVEL import check (the GLY §F rules above) in
    addition to `CheckFGAxioms`. The closure-root check compares library
    roots only and cannot enforce "S/Pure only"; it stays as the axiom
    guard, with the one new root `AvailableChainGeneric`.
- The idea map is keyed by G id (GLY §B). 31 rules, 22 with a mechanical
  check (GLY §F); GLY r3.8 adds the module-level import rule.
- **KitV2 cores (P6, L33; replaces A3).** KitV2 `stateBefore_step_induction`
  and `ownRecord_fold_interval` are the CORES of the induction and
  record-fold ideas (G08, FOLDS). The Gen `P/V2/Induction` and `P/V2/Fields`
  forms, including the restart-tolerant own-record fold that T7.9 A needs,
  are corollaries proved from these cores, with no second proof.
  `invariant_clock_le` becomes a wrapper of `stateBefore_invariant` or is
  dropped. The frozen `ownRecord_fold` (NoRestart) stays. Client safety
  takes no `NoRestart` premise. Route for T7.9 A (lead, R1): one Gen
  theorem `ownRecord_fold_restart` in P/V2/Fields (projection laws for
  clock, process and recordOwn; a restart premise that the durable part
  keeps the projection); proof by induction on j, each non-restart step is
  the frozen `ownRecord_fold_interval` over [j, j+1). R2 (E-10
  `invariant_triple`) cannot carry the fold: its predicate reads the state,
  the fold reads the event prefix (`TS/codex/scratch/audit-fgsa-items-
  bc9747f0.md`).
- **Generic manifest (GLY Q-8).** The checker design (a second scope of
  `V2Manifest` or a copy) closes before the E-9 statements freeze.
- **Migration** (GLY §E), all additive and without renames. Timing by first
  consumer:
  - statement round before G-F0a: E-12 (generic skeleton, reads with
    `Run.nthIdx?`, rules), **E-9 statements** (receipt: DeliveryWithin,
    the trigger, TimelyClock, the acceptance and admission laws,
    `timely_*`, `accepted_by_deadline`, the first-acceptance bridge,
    LabelSync; their consumers T7.7, T7.12a and LabelSync come before
    G-F0a), **E-11 statement** (store-invariant bundle; T7.5 and T7.7 use
    it), E-1 (block order), E-3 (same-name split of the walk definitions
    into `GridCO/Model/Walk`, bodies byte-identical, importing only Mathlib
    and `Model.Objects.*`), E-19 (`KitFG.StoreInvDef`), E-15 (T7.W merge
    into KitFG/Certificates), the KitFG `ViewLock` and `HonestRows`
    definitions (owner lean-framework; T7.9 A needs HonestRows);
  - before F1: E-5 (KitFG `WeightsBridge`; the nine F1-cited statements
    stay on `Electorate`), **E-14** (history restatement; S3 D06 timing),
    E-16 (fold), E-18 (StoreKeys/StoreFacts; FGSA chain 40 → about 15);
  - before F1b.4: E-4 (suffix family); before F1.3: the E-7 statements;
    before F1.7: the FG part of E-13 (binder-free lemmas under new names;
    the old names stay as wrappers until after F2); before F3: the E-8
    core; E-10 (first-bad pure/run split; retires S1's interim Foundations
    copy) before its first run consumer, named in GLY r3.8;
  - E-9 and E-11 proofs: §9 step 3 (L34).
  After F2: the deletions of E-2, E-6, E-8, E-16, E-17, the E-13
  wrappers and the E-14 restatement. The Grid CO and SA-PC relocations wait behind fixed facade
  names.

## 5. Frozen interfaces

A signature freezes only in its written form. No frozen signature contains
`…` (review fix O4). GLY r3.8 writes each one in full.

**Audit results (GLY r3.8 deviations).** A1 and A2 PASS in both A0
audits; A3 FAILED and is replaced by L33 (§4). A1: AdmitSound without `wellFormed`,
and the carried-child lemma. A2: j at the trigger time; `Monotone dl` and
`t < dl t` are fields of LabelSync and T7.12 (and `t < dl t` at the
trigger time is also a premise of `accepted_by_deadline`, L32); `hrestore : now
(restore d) = 0` (an equality: a restart has no time condition, so a
delivery can precede the next tick; both instances restore to 0). A3 (as
audited): no Gen twins of the KitV2 lemmas; superseded by L33.
Also recorded: the E-15 survivor is `fgHead_stored`; the first run consumer
of E-10 is T7.5 (inferred from G08).

- **V2-API:** no break. Additive fixes I-1 … I-7 (S2 §5; GLY §D).
- **Timeliness (L19).** `TimelyClock` keeps its GLY fields (`clock :
  ClockLaws P`, `actTime`, `clockOf`, `clockOf_eq`, `timely_iff`).
  `actTime o` is the ADMISSION THRESHOLD of the handler, not the honest
  send time: the start of slot s (4Δs) for a HEAD or a proposal of slot s;
  the start of round r (4ΔRr) for a row of round r. Then `timely_iff`
  matches the handler's future test exactly (GridCO Protocol.lean:304–306:
  `current < r`; FGSA Handlers.lean:20–22: `now < r`), and every honest
  emission is at or after its threshold. The Grid CO instance (SA
  milestone) uses the same rule.
- **Admission law, trigger, timeliness (L19, L30).** The written forms are
  in GLY §C.3 (`AdmitSound P C`, THE ONE WRITTEN FORM; `Trigger`;
  `timely_of_clock`, `timely_of_emit`, `timely_of_relay`); this document
  cites them and does not restate binders. Summary: `AdmitSound` concludes
  `Timely` only, under `0 ≤ clockOf st` (L30: false at a negative clock).
  Well-formedness of a handled object comes from `DeliveryWellFormed.wire`
  at the receiver's own envelope plus `handles_wellFormed` (T7.7).
  `Trigger` = honest emission or an honest `acceptsAt` (covers faulty
  signed objects). The producers bound `actTime o` by `pubFloor t` at the
  TRIGGER time t; `timely_of_relay` needs `hrestore : now (restore d) = 0`.
  `timely_of_clock` then gives `Timely` at any index i after the receiver's
  tick at that floor, over a restart-free interval.
- **I-3 acceptance law** `AcceptanceLaw P Timely Inv` (GLY §C.3, L3):
  handled ∧ depsPresent ∧ wellFormed ∧ Timely at the pre-state ⇒
  `processed st' o ∨ excludes st' o` at `st' = process st o′`, at every
  state that satisfies Inv, with `Inv := CStoreInv`. Inv is needed in
  THREE refusal cases, all covered by `CStoreInv`: (1) `B ⪯ F`; (2)
  `eraseF ⪯ b` strictly with `F ⋠ fgBlock P b rows` (Handlers.lean:49);
  (3) the FG test accepts and the base `admitProposal` refuses, so the
  carried HEADs are skipped (Handlers.lean:61–72; `CStoreInv.baseTree`).
  T7.7 lists all three, so its stop rule "a refusal in none of these cases"
  does not fire. The disjunct is needed: a carried batch can fill a
  per-(identity, round) cap inside one delivery. Negative controls: the
  FG-SA row cap (instance test); the Grid CO three HEADs of one faulty seat
  as a STORE-LEVEL test over `GridCO.process` (gridCO is a v1
  ProtocolSpec, so it is not a V2 instance test).
- **`excludes_process` (L20).** Not a field of the frozen law: no generic
  lemma consumes it (`accepted_by_deadline` uses
  `HooksSound.excludes_stable`). It stays as an instance lemma (FGSARun
  Proofs/Excludes.lean:455; GridCO Proofs/Hooks.lean:96–98).
- **`accepted_by_deadline` (written form in GLY r3.10).** Required
  premises, each named:
  1. the trigger at t (either producer) and the `DeliveryWithin` field that
     it uses; honest sender and honest receiver w;
  2. `t < dl t` for the trigger time (L32: without it the theorem is
     false; an acceptance at t = dl t is not before the deadline state;
     Astra O25 review) and `dl t ≤ cut` (no horizon premise: GLY r3.11
     dropped `hhor`, which no step used);
  3. schedule well-formedness and `HooksSound` (`excludes_stable`) and
     `processed_stable` as named premises (neither follows from the laws
     above: a protocol whose tick clears the processed store meets them and
     fails the conclusion);
  4. READINESS of the handled object at every handling event before the
     deadline: `wellFormed o` and `depsPresent st o`. `DeliveryWellFormed`
     covers only the delivered envelope, so Generic states readiness as a
     premise with producers: dependency-free kinds (FG-SA HEADs and rows,
     `depsS = true`, a structural law), `DeliveryWellFormed.wire` plus the
     carried-child lemma `handles_wellFormed` (T7.7; AdmitSound gives
     `Timely` only, A1), and honest emission (T7.9 B,
     `honest_emit_wellFormed`). T7.8 takes it
     as a premise; the assembly supplies it (P10), so T7.8 does not wait
     for T7.9 B;
  5. the admission-time bound through the timeliness core;
  6. the index interval: j = w's tick at `pubFloor t` (the TRIGGER time:
     the premises do not know the handling time; `restartFree rho w j k`
     then covers the tick at `pubFloor t′` that `timely_of_clock` uses;
     AUDIT FOCUS A2); k = the length of the
     STRICT event prefix before `dl t`, with `stateBefore k =
     stateBeforeTime (dl t)`, also when `dl t` is past the last event;
     `restartFree rho w j k` (half-open [j, k), Schedule.lean:37–41);
  7. `excludes (stateBeforeTime (dl t) w) o = false` (not excluded AT THE
     DEADLINE STATE; for an honest row from `excludesS_honestRow_false`).
     The earlier hNX form was false (S3 review M1).
  Conclusion: `processed (stateBeforeTime (dl t) w) o`. The relay case
  where w already processed o at the trigger index is closed by
  `processed_stable`. Argument names follow `Schedule.lean:40`
  (`restartFree rho v i j`) in every document.
- **First-acceptance bridge (new; 1c).** `accepted_by_deadline` concludes
  `processed`. 1c's `AcceptsAll` also needs "unprocessed before the
  emission" and an actual `acceptsAt` event in [t, deadline). One Gen V2
  lemma `firstAccept_of_processed` derives the event from the unprocessed
  pre-state and the processed deadline state; 1c proves the freshness
  facts (`EmitReady.fresh`, `Feasible.clock_unprocessed`, `Feasible.indep`)
  and instantiates it. Owner lean-framework, statement in the E-9 round.
  1c.7 does not repeat the handler partition.
- **Label timing** (GLY §C.5): `LabelSync E rho vt dt := ∃ dl cut,
  DeliveryWithin E rho dl cut ∧ Monotone dl ∧ (∀ t, t < dl t) ∧ (∀ t, dl t
  ≤ max t vt + Δ) ∧ vt + Δ ≤ dt ∧ dt ≤ cut ∧ dt ≤ horizon`, and `LabelFacts
  := {sync, batch}`. The `syncFrom` field bounds the relay of an
  acceptance at every t′ (also t′ > vt: `dl t′ ≤ t′ + Δ`). Producers
  `of_cleanCut`, `of_recovery`. The relay of early FAULTY votes goes
  through the relay trigger and `timely_of_relay` above. **O25 is CLOSED**:
  the written consumer check (r5 134eca23; durable copy
  `AC/claude-files/a0/labelsync-consumers.md`; two Astra reviews) covers
  same-label compatibility, forward and reverse transport, score equality,
  TVote, the release and healing uses, and found no field change.
- **I-4 `Obs V`:** the proposed block of a slot is optional (slot 0).
  **I-2:** Channels + base transport; `fgsaIso.base = State p.n` is forced.
- **One deadline read:** `HoldsBefore` over `stateBeforeTime`, with
  `holdsBefore_iff_exists_idx`.
- **Receipt:** `DeliveryWithin E rho dl cut` in Gen V2/Receipt (it
  replaces ReceiptForm/psForm/hpdForm), with two producers
  (PartialSynchrony: `max t GST + Δ`, horizon; HealthyPrefixDelivery b₀:
  `t + Δ`, b₀). ONE T7.12 statement for Clean, P1 and Recovery, in
  `FGSARun/Statements`; the slot-window premise is a named field whose
  trigger is the §5 `Trigger` (a faulty-proposed path block arrives by
  relay); the proof uses only `Monotone dl` and `t < dl t`.
  `Statements/ReceiptCoverage` for both forms is frozen at the T7.12a gate
  (S3c M3; O28).
- **Exclusion.** `excludes_inert_epoch` (one restart epoch, monotone clock)
  is the proof tool; the frozen HooksSound fields stay (one-state
  inertness, restart-free stability). TRowsSync.receipt uses
  `excludesS_honestRow_false` + `rowPool_provenance` + `processed_stable`.
  **Spec direction** (spec 8ef4ed3b Relay remark): Lean also lets the
  network skip a HEAD or row that the handler always refuses (old label,
  full cap). The Lean receipt premise is therefore weaker than the spec
  premise: every spec run meets it. T7 r13 adds this to its declared spec
  differences.
- **Claim-level shapes:** §2 "Fixed shapes"; the S1 §4.1 freeze items
  #16–#30 as adopted in S3.

## 6. Instantiation pattern

Authority: **GLY §C**: five mechanisms and two worked chains, quorum
intersection → FG finality lock → FG-SA view lock; DeliveryWithin + Trigger
→ AcceptanceLaw/AdmitSound → FG-SA receipt. A third chain of the same
pattern is planned in P3 (OPEN 7, before G-F0b): QualSearch (Rec_s | Rec_c
| Lit) → healing time → HTimeBestStatement. The pattern: a generic statement over
a small record; one producer lemma per regime, trigger or protocol; the
claim cites the generic statement through the producer; no second proof.

## 7. Build

Authority: **`claude-files/a0/build.md` r3.7 bf8b643a** (lean-framework;
r3.8 with the G-F0a package adds `gate.sh --critical-path`, L46;
final §Build; it replaces the draft-1 text and goes into
`docs/LEAN-ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 at adoption). Summary:

- 7.1 the module system is the primary rule (B0). A proof-only edit
  rebuilds 1 module (measured on rc2 and v4.34.1). Two exceptions: a new
  exported equation lemma (B3a prevents it) and a changed axiom set
  (B3b). An exposed computable definition is vocabulary: its edit is an
  interface edit.
- 7.2 rules B0–B10, B3a, B3b with their state on main a6733c2.
- 7.3 checks (a)–(g): no exception on the new libraries; a main baseline
  on the legacy libraries (875 eq-like findings). Check (e) is the
  module-level layer/import check of the §4 rules (L25) and the E-18 guard.
  (f) unused imports (O19, `shake` or a script) is scoped after the port.
  `AvailableChainCheckSupport` (imports only `Lean`) holds the shared
  check code.
- 7.4 FG-SA layout: FGSARun → FGSAClaims → FGSAProofs / FGSAInhabit /
  Tests → Assembly; cross-lane facts are `Prop`s in
  `FGSAClaims/Statements/ChannelProps` (`Statements/Channels` holds only the
  read definitions that the Props use), and only Assembly closes them (P10).
- 7.5 the port by the approved re-baseline procedure (L16).
- 7.6 the wrapper and the NUC rule; measured cold 724 s / critical path
  296 s (Mac, old wrapper) vs 264 s / 155 s (NUC). FG-SA critical path
  (FGSA + FGSARun, NUC, 3 slots, cold, dab6bf3): 100 s, the G-F0a
  target; a gate above 120 s blocks. Not comparable to 155 s (whole repo).
- 7.7 build agents and gates: `scripts/gate.sh` with MERGE and FULL tiers,
  one global slot cap (3 on the Mac and the NUC), and on the NUC a required
  MemoryMax=16G scope (after the 2026-09-30 OOM incident; L46).

build.md r2–r3 apply the lead amendments and record the port result:
`FGSAProofs/Shared/*` is not a lane and FGSAProofs may import it (check
(e)); Shared may also import the upstream libraries (L31; r3.1);
the lock and the manifest
hash elaborated statements and definition values (a proof term inside a
definition value counts), not theorem proofs.

## 8. Decision register (lead, 2026-09-29)

S3 §1 (D01–D79) is the claim-level register. The lead register (L1–L46;
L40–L46 added after adoption, 2026-09-30):

**T7.14 obligations:** (a) an old object re-admitted after a restart is
harmless, or the exclusion becomes durable; (b) the `restartFree`
premises of `timely_*` AND `accepted_by_deadline` (discharge or
RestartsPublic). Claims keep `NoRestart`, so claim Props do not change if
T7.14 picks durable exclusion; the AcceptanceLaw instance Inv and the
restartFree consumers can.

## 9. Gates and order of work

Gates (P3:242–247): **G-F0a** freezes the skeleton, reads, regimes,
recurrence forms, window specs (with OD10), safety claims and safety channel
tiers, and gates F2.0. **G-F0b** freezes HEALED, HEALING_INPUT, the
finality claims, the finality and healing tiers, QualSearch and the Shared
Fold/Phases statements, and gates F4 and F5.

G-F0a is gated BY T7 work: the regimes are F0b, and "F0b needs T7.2–T7.5"
(P3:242); F0.2 needs T7.6 item 3; F0.6a and F0.8a need T7.5 and T7.9 A.
The steps below are one dependency list. A step starts when every item it
names is done; items inside one step run in parallel.

At every later step the same rule applies: a new shared statement is placed
by P1–P11 before its first consumer, and a claim change goes through the
register.

Closed since draft 1: O03, O08 (D48), O12, O14 (S3:1385–1387); the spec
drift (spec 8ef4ed3b). Other notes: S1c §3.4 candidate strengthenings stay
with the blueprint owner (not claims); 01 §6.5 paired-run argument is
paper-only unless a Lean consumer appears.

## 12. Audit fold (draft 2 → draft 3)

Audits of draft 2 (ced1917d): `TS/codex/reports/a0-audit-astra.md`
(REVISE: B1, M1, M2, m1) and `TS/codex/reports/a0-audit-opus.md` (ADOPT
WITH FIXES: M1–M7, m1–m16, 24 fixes). Both passed every frozen generic
interface at the boundaries (Opus: 25 counterexample attempts) and the spec
edit 8ef4ed3b. Other inputs: fgsa-lean's OPEN 7 draft with its Astra review
(C1–C8), and `TS/codex/scratch/a0-audit-fold-inputs.md`.
