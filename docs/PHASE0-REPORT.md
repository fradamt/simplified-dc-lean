# Phase 0 report — protocol framework prototype

_Written for the Phase 1–2 plan. Scope: `AvailableChainFramework` and
`AvailableChainRegistry` (`docs/FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md` v7, §8, row P = 0).
Task references (Task 1–9) point to the per-task `git log` commits
(`Framework: …`) that built this scope; the plan is
`docs/plans/2026-09-28-framework-phase0.md`._

## 1. Purpose

Phase 0 built a compiled prototype of the protocol framework design
(`docs/FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md` §§1–7) on the v1 engine, to test the design's
interfaces with the Lean compiler before Phase 1 commits to the full v1
catalog. It added two Lake libraries: `AvailableChainFramework` (the
catalog and certificate framework, L1–L3 and a kit) and
`AvailableChainRegistry` (protocol instances with certificates and
refutations over the framework, L4). `docs/MAP.md` has the module map
for both libraries.

```

Sanity fails the core floor exactly as the design predicts: it always
returns genesis and permanently excludes every object, so
`includedConfirmed` has no valid delay `D` (`Sanity.refutedIncluded`,
a `RefutationFamily`). Counter, a new toy height protocol built for
Phase 0, passes the core floor, including exact-time inclusion at
`D = 1` (`Counter.candidate : Candidate counterInst`).

## 3. What each interface showed

**Validators bundling.** Phase 0 bundles a run's validator type with its
`DecidableEq` and `Fintype` instances into one structure, `Validators`.
This is a Phase 0 implementation choice: design §3's `Instance` sketch
does not mention it. A claim's `regime` and `conclusion` fields quantify
over `W : Validators`, not over a bare type with separate instance
arguments. Every certificate (Sanity, Counter, the Pareto test) builds
one `Validators` value (for example `⟨Fin 1, inferInstance,
inferInstance⟩`) and both fields consume it as a single argument. Phase
0 used only one validator type per instance, so the bundling did not
need to carry a value across a "widen the electorate" transport; that
case is untested.

**Point.** `Point` holds a claim's own run parameters, apart from its
constant. `safeOf`-built claims (`safeConfirmed`, `safeStable`) and
`includedConfirmed` all use `Time` as `Point`, for the Sleepy regime's
start time `t₀` (`Catalog/Core.lean:25,70`), not a read time or a
proposal slot. `prefixOrder` uses `Unit`, for no free parameter. The
three claims share one `ClaimSpec` shape with no change to
`Claim.lean`, which is the point of the field: `Point` lets a claim's
own witness shape vary without a change to the catalog's record type.

**Type-class facets.** Deviation (d) drops `ClaimSpec.needs` as a
field. Task 6 adds a facet, `HasStrong`, as a plain Lean type class
over `Instance` (`class HasStrong (I : Instance) where strong : …`).
It compiled with no change to `Instance`, `ClaimSpec`, or any existing
declaration: a new facet is an addition, as the design predicts.

`safeStrong` is a `Prop`, not a `ClaimSpec`; the test shows only that a
facet class compiles, not that the catalog can state a claim that needs
one. `ClaimSpec` cannot yet state a claim that needs a facet
(strong-1): `regime`, `conclusion`, and `trigger` take only `I :
Instance`, and `Const` and `Point` do not depend on `I`. A type-class
facet also lets two instances attach to one `I`, which breaks "bound
once" (§3). Fix planned: Phase 1 carrier generalization. See also the
Facet row of §6, Open items, for the shape's vacuity issue.

**Cert as data.** `Cert c I` is a structure, not a bare proof term: it
carries `const`, `valid`, `inhabited`, and `proof` as fields.
`scripts/Registry.lean` finds every certificate by scanning constant
TYPES (`Cert c I`, `Refutation c I`, `RefutationFamily c I`), not by
reading `@[cert]`/`@[refutes]` attributes (deviation (a)). `Cert.weaken`
builds a new `Cert` value at a weaker constant from an old one's
`proof` field, through `ClaimSpec.transport`, with no re-proof. The
registry lists seven certificates (3 Sanity, 4 Counter) and one
refutation-family over Sanity and Counter, 8 rows total;
`Candidate`/`ProfileCert` values are not rows, because
their type is a `Pi`-type over `c ∈ p.claims`, not `Cert c I` itself
(Open items, §6).

**Type 1.** `ClaimSpec` has two `Type`-valued fields, `Const` and
`Point`. A structure with a `Type`-valued field is itself one universe
higher than an ordinary data structure, so `ClaimSpec : Type 1`.
`ProfileCert` and `Catalog.Candidate` quantify over a `List ClaimSpec`,
so both widen from the plan's `Type` to `Type 1` (deviation (f)). This
is a plan defect only: the universe is forced by `ClaimSpec`'s shape,
not by a proof gap, and no other declaration changed to accommodate
it.

## 4. The Grid CO Step 1 finding

Task 7 tested the design's E4 (permanent exclude) classification
against a Grid CO variant, `gridCOx`, whose only change from `gridCO`
is its `excludes` function. Step 1 asked whether the
equivocation-exclusion disjunct could be dropped from `excludes`: kept
only if some clock evaluation removes a vote, dropped otherwise. The
proof (`clock_votes`, `AvailableChainRegistry/GridCOHooks.lean`)
established that no clock evaluation — `expire`, `freeze`, the early
save, `release`, or `gate` — writes `st.votes`. Only `admitVote`
(called from `process`, never from `clock`) appends to it. Every clock
step reads or replays existing votes; none removes one.

The finding keeps the equivocation-exclusion disjunct in
`gridExcludes`: an already-equivocating seat stays excluded until the
epoch ends, because nothing in `clock` would ever revoke that
exclusion. `Deliverable`, `RelayFeasible`, and `WindowMargin` for Grid
CO move to Phase 1, with the `excludes` change in `gridCO` itself
(deviation (b)).

Deviations (a)–(d) were accepted with the plan, before implementation
(`docs/plans/2026-09-28-framework-phase0.md`, "Deviations from the
spec"). Deviations (e) and (f) surfaced during implementation and
review (Task 6, Task 1–3) and are recorded here for the first time.
Deviations (g)–(i) surfaced during the final whole-branch review and
are recorded here for the first time. Deviations (e)–(i) are recorded
in `docs/FRAMEWORK-DESIGN.md` §8.

### 5.2 Proof-level deviations (no statement changed)

and registry matches its brief exactly. The changes below are to proof
scripts, tactics, or witness terms only.

│        │ classify were missing). An unreadable or missing lock file on  │

│ 7      │ gridExcludes_inert and gridCOx_hooks are proved in full (see   │

│        │ brief's named fallback helper, foldl_recordOwn_base, because   │
│        │ the direct rewrite-then-induction proof leaves an unmatched    │

│        │ directly, because counter_safe quantifies over every run and   │
│        │ Run.readAt is a filter of events, not a prefix. candidate is   │
│        │ noncomputable: hc : c ∈ core.claims is an Or, which cannot     │
