# FG-SA stage-4 non-vacuity plan

Base: df5ca51. Plan §1.3–§1.7 witness shapes and §5.4 checks apply.
C/ and P/ have the same meanings as in the producer map.
Every row states the witness shape, current test evidence, and remaining duty.
No test of a contract type is a proof of a LAW instance.

W1–W4 on lf-w2 use the old model and are paused until S4.6. Then the lead
assigns one Astra port of W1 to W. That lane must supply a valid, positive
execution with actual admitted carriers, honest emissions and receipts.
Stage 5 must supply the listed package and service witnesses on that execution.

S4.4a N6: no package with a horizon field has a non-vacuity witness. Horizon
0 in HealingW cannot meet its positive healing/reset bounds. FinalityW uses
horizon 512, but supplies only schedules and conditional package constructions.
S4.3 N7: the no-replay birth case can only be a raw fold. Its finality payload
at the birth height fails R3; do not count it as an admitted execution.

Witness rows: 91.

Focused cases already exist: WindowRetention:72,84 (eviction without coverage
and later coverage), :98 (both R6W arms), :205 (several ready entries),
:220 (raw no replay). P/Tests/FinalityW:34,79 separates exact-q finality and
earlier-or-current height batches; :115 covers the lower key with a greater
ready key. C/Tests/FinalityW:26–27 checks κ=R, large ΔF and boundary equality.
The FF7 second horizon at C/Tests/FinalityW:126 is a projection only.
LocalHealing, PhaseWitness and UniversalLeases remain internal stage-5 witness
plans. No frozen standalone claim or new premise is introduced for them.

S4.5b follow-up: G1–G4 contracts and restored packages are absent now. Add a
witness-plan row when each W statement is restored. S4.5b and then W1/stage 5
own positive-horizon witnesses for CleanInclusionPrem and ExactProposalPrem.
S4.6 removes the old non-W FinForm packages and moves best/search healing to
Companion/HealedBest. Their old shapes are not W witness requirements.
