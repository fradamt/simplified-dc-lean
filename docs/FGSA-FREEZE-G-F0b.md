# FG-SA G-F0b freeze record (W model)

Candidate content: fgsa-s46e (S4.6 + S4.6b + S4.6c + TDel / review fixes + S4.7 pre-freeze round), reviewed at
845d13e; the S4.7 fix round adds 0848d69 and this record (037ea95); B21, B25, B31 and B32 follow. The S4.8 freeze commit
replaces docs/FGSA-API-frozen.md with docs/FGSA-API.md at that head (scripts/fgsa-freeze.sh), resets
scripts/fgsa-manifest-allow.txt to its header line, and checks the new freeze with
`NEG=0 bash scripts/check-fgsa-manifest.sh`.

## Reviews

S4.7 freeze review, brief codex/jobs/s47-freeze-review.md (sha256 fee6aeb3b0f4), two models:
- Opus: FREEZE WITH FIXES, 0 blockers (TS/codex/reports/s47-freeze-review-opus-full.md).
- Astra: FREEZE WITH FIXES, 0 blockers (TS/codex/reports/s47-freeze-review-astra-full.md).
Combined lead ruling: TS/codex/reports/f07w-rulings.md, "S4.7 FREEZE REVIEW — combined ruling" (2026-10-02 20:41).
Both reviews found the genesis growth gap; CleanGrowthClaim + AwakeProposerRecurrenceFrom + the aggregate field
`cleanGrowth` close it (0848d69). The TDel ancestor question is closed (Astra checked in Lean).

## Ruled exceptions to the review-brief wording

The brief's literal checks "byte-identical to G-F0a" and "no ΔF dependency in any safety statement" do not hold
literally on this migrated surface. These are the exact, ruled exceptions:

1. FGSASafetyInterfaces (AvailableChainFGSAClaims/FGSAClaims.lean) is NOT byte-identical to G-F0a: its five
   explicit run binders changed from V2.Run to V2.D.Run (06 Duty port, 3d48ca8), and one comment changed. The
   hash moves have allow lines and semantic-ledger rows (Astra F4; Opus F7). FGSASafetyClaims keeps its G-F0a
   field list.
2. "No ΔF dependency in any safety statement": the G1/G2 finality-safety claims and the G-F0a structural safety
   claims have no row-delay, κ, recurrence or timeout premise. The exceptions are the Clean safety claims
   CleanSafetyClaim, CleanCutClaim, CleanHistoryClaim and CleanPrefixTruncationClaim (and CleanCutZeroClaim):
   they quantify `{ΔF : Time}` through their Clean regime packages (CleanPrem / CleanCutPrem / CleanPrefixPrem:
   "FG-SA rows have their own delivery bound", user 2026-10-01). Their conclusions hold for every row delay; ΔF
   only describes the healthy prefix (Astra §5 check 6 and :412).
3. DC table: Recovery₂.gap has the STRENGTH of DC SingleProposerRecurrence (from GST, over windows that end within
   the horizon) in the ROLE of DC RecoveryRegime.recurrence (DC: MultiProposerRecurrence). INTENTIONAL: it follows
   blueprint 21 ProposalGap; it is not strengthened (Astra F5; Opus S4.6c F5). The clean case uses
   AwakeProposerRecurrenceFrom (SingleProposerRecurrence role + the INTENTIONAL awake condition).

4. Exact-row service (Centaur Astra finality-route audit, TS/codex/reports/centaur/fgsa-s5-b1-core.md §8, M2):
   TRowsSelect and TRowsSync state exact-row service. The modeled proposer carries every valid held non-ancestor row
   (full inclusion, Model/Frame.lean proposalRows), so the exact-row disjunction is the modeled policy. The blueprint
   also permits an optional effect-preserving selection (22:323, 22:695; 01:83–86); that selection is not modeled,
   and paper T-ROWS must not be used to inhabit this stronger exact-row contract. No statement change.

## Post-review statement change (ruling B21)

After both reviews, the H-PHASE Opus review (F3) found that PhaseInterval, AttemptValid and RPhase required a
frontier of at least 2, but H.10 runs attempts at m = 1 (21:1467–1468, 2570–2571); the rise 1 → 2 then had no
contract route. Lead ruling B21 (evidence TS/codex/reports/m1-check-opus-full.md): relax to 1 ≤ m in PhaseInterval
(ChannelProps), RPhase clauses 1, 2, 3, 5 and RPhase_def, and AttemptValid (1 ≤ k.frontier). The premises become
weaker; each statement stays true at m = 1 (the frontier-1 frame is top J with J = genesis; 21:286, 1236). The gap
frame keeps R.j + 2 ≤ m (21:1191–1203). No G-F0a frozen name moves.

## Post-review statement change (ruling B25)

An Opus check of Centaur's H-FRAME plan found that PhaseInterval's lower cut `timeIdx rho u ≤ i` lies after all
events at u, but a HEAD at v_s = u reads stateBefore its tick, at an index before timeIdx u (ticks come before
deliveries at u). TPerm (`u ≤ voteTime s`) and TRepair branch 2 then had no blueprint route at equality (bp 754–755,
824, 1151–1162: "settled at u" includes HEADs at v_s = u). Lead ruling B25 (s5-plan-amendments.md §G): the lower cut
is `V2.D.Run.idxBefore rho u ≤ i`. Nothing else changes; TFrontier's h_max cap keeps timeIdx. No G-F0a frozen name
moves.

## Post-review statement change (ruling B31)

lean-framework's H-SUPPORT writer found a counterexample to TPerm through Transfers S3, and an Opus check found the
same end-of-run defect in two more clauses: a range that starts at afterTicksIdx / HealSuffix of a cut c is
{events.length} when c is past the interval end or the horizon, so the clause asserted coverage of the final state
although the gate at c never ran (the blueprint speaks only of outputs after that gate). Lead ruling B31
(s5-plan-amendments.md §I) adds guards only: Transfers S3 `SA.gateTime s + 4Δ ≤ v` (21:717); H2A output
`p.actionTime r + 4Δ ≤ rho.horizon` (21:3289–3291); H5RawTransfer output `SA.gateTime j + 4Δ ≤ rho.horizon`
(21:3321); and RFProv takes `H0 p c E rho w` as its first premise, as TDelReset does. No G-F0a frozen name moves.

## Post-review statement change (ruling B32)

Centaur's FREEZE-HORIZON audit (365 definitions screened) confirmed the four B31 items and found two more. Lead
ruling B32 (s5-plan-amendments.md §J): RKeep takes `H0 p c E rho w` as its first premise, as TDelReset (with an
arbitrary witness its conclusion `w.M + 1 ≤ st.fg.h_max` is false on a real run); CleanGrowthClaim takes `0 ≤ t`
before its horizon bound, because Time = Int and a negative trigger gives a deadline before 0 (DC LiveFrom has
`t₀ ≤ t`, Generic/Properties.lean:105). AvailableGrowthConcl is unchanged. No G-F0a frozen name moves.

## Gates

- aaeb71c and 037ea95: FULL gates stopped before completion (superseded by later pre-freeze heads; lead).
- f7eafbe (B21 head): FULL gate stopped at fgsa-manifest (superseded by B25; lead).
- 572da1a (f7eafbe + main eacee7b + B25): FULL gate PASS on the NUC (gate wall 3290 s) and fg(mac) PASS. Landed:
  main = 572da1a. The B31 and B32 changes followed, so this head is not the freeze head.
- 46b8f58 (final head = 572da1a + B31 + B32): FULL gate PASS on the NUC (gate wall 3256 s; build, check-build,
  check-fgsa, check-fgsa-run, catalog-lock, manifests, fgsa-manifest, fgsa-claims, axioms) and fg(mac) PASS (313 s).
  Landed: main = 46b8f58.
- S4.8 freeze commit: docs/FGSA-API-frozen.md = docs/FGSA-API.md at 46b8f58 (1127 entries, 45 modules; the trailing
  blank line that `scripts/fgsa-freeze.sh` copies is removed and the SHA-256 is recomputed);
  scripts/fgsa-manifest-allow.txt reset to its header line; `NEG=0 bash scripts/check-fgsa-manifest.sh` PASS.
